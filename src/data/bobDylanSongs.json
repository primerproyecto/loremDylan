    "lyrics": "\n I crossed the green mountain, I slept by the stream \n\nHeaven blazin’ in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream \n\nSomething came up out of the sea\n\nSwept through the land of the rich and the free\n\n\n\nI look into the eyes of my merciful friend\n\nAnd then I ask myself, is this the end? \n\nMemories linger, sad yet sweet\n\nAnd I think of the souls in heaven who will meet\n\n\n\nAltars are burning with flames falling wide\n\nThe foe has crossed over from the other side\n\nThey tip their caps from the top of the hill\n\nYou can feel them come, more brave blood to spill\n\n\n\nAlong the dim Atlantic line\n\nThe ravaged land lies for miles behind\n\nThe light’s comin’ forward and the streets are broad \n\nAll must yield to the avenging God\n\n\n\nThe world is old, the world is gray\n\nLessons of life can’t be learned in a day\n\nI watch and I wait and I listen while I stand\n\nTo the music that comes from a far better land\n\n\n\nClose the eyes of our Captain, peace may he know \n\nHis long night is done, the great leader is laid low \n\nHe was ready to fall, he was quick to defend\n\nKilled outright he was by his own men\n\n\n\nIt’s the last day’s last hour of the last happy year \n\nI feel that the unknown world is so near\n\nPride will vanish and glory will rot\n\nBut virtue lives and cannot be forgot\n\n\n\nThe bells of evening have rung\n\nThere’s blasphemy on every tongue\n\nLet them say that I walked in fair nature’s light \n\nAnd that I was loyal to truth and to right\n\n\n\nServe God and be cheerful, look upward beyond\n\nBeyond the darkness that masks the surprises of dawn\n\nIn the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood\n\nThey never dreamed of surrendering. They fell where they stood\n\n\n\nStars fell over Alabama, I saw each star\n\nYou’re walkin’ in dreams whoever you are \n\nChilled are the skies, keen is the frost\n\nThe ground’s froze hard and the morning is lost\n\n\n\nA letter to mother came today\n\nGunshot wound to the breast is what it did say \n\nBut he’ll be better soon he’s in a hospital bed \n\nBut he’ll never be better, he’s already dead\n\n\n\nI’m ten miles outside the city and I’m lifted away\n\nIn an ancient light that is not of day\n\nThey were calm, they were blunt, we knew ’em all too well \n\nWe loved each other more than we ever dared to tell\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 2002 by Special Rider Music</p>\n",

Oh, Angelina\n\n\n\nI see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force\n\nI can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse\n\nIn God’s truth tell me what you want and you’ll have it of course\n\nJust step into the arena\n\n\n\nBeat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases\n\nPass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces\n\nBegging God for mercy and weepin’ in unholy places\n\nAngelina\n\n\n\nOh, Angelina.

    "lyrics": "\nI once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze\n\nWith the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn\n\nI courted her proudly but now she is gone\n\nGone as the season she’s taken\n\n\n\nThrough young summer’s breeze, I stole her away\n\nFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stay\n\nEach one of them suffering from the failures of their day\n\nWith strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us\n\n\n\nOf the two sisters, I loved the young\n\nWith sensitive instincts, she was the creative one\n\nThe constant scapegoat, she was easily undone\n\nBy the jealousy of others around her\n\n\n\nFor her parasite sister, I had no respect\n\nBound by her boredom, her pride to protect\n\nCountless visions of the other she’d reflect\n\nAs a crutch for her scenes and her society\n\n\n\nMyself, for what I did, I cannot be excused\n\nThe changes I was going through can’t even be used\n\nFor the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose\n\nThe could-be dream-lover of my lifetime\n\n\n\nWith unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip\n\nA magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped\n\nNoticing not that I’d already slipped\n\nTo a sin of love’s false security\n\n\n\nFrom silhouetted anger to manufactured peace\n\nAnswers of emptiness, voice vacancies\n\nTill the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “Please\n\nWhat’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter?”\n\n\n\nAnd so it did happen like it could have been foreseen\n\nThe timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream\n\nAt the peak of the night, the king and the queen\n\nTumbled all down into pieces\n\n\n\n“The tragic figure!” her sister did shout\n\n“Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!”\n\nAnd I in my armor, turning about\n\nAnd nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness\n\n\n\nBeneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound\n\nHer sister and I in a screaming battleground\n\nAnd she in between, the victim of sound\n\nSoon shattered as a child ’neath her shadows\n\n\n\nAll is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight\n\nI gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight\n\nMy mind it was mangled, I ran into the night\n\nLeaving all of love’s ashes behind me\n\n\n\nThe wind knocks my window, the room it is wet\n\nThe words to say I’m sorry, I haven’t found yet\n\nI think of her often and hope whoever she’s met\n\nWill be fully aware of how precious she is\n\n\n\nAh, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me\n\n“How good, how good does it feel to be free?”\n\nAnd I answer them most mysteriously\n\n“Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?”\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1964 by Warner Bros.

It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel\n\n\n\nWell, we drove that car all night into San Anton’\n\nAnd we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft\n\nWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back\n\nI would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off\n\n\n\nWell, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies\n\nNow I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul\n\nBut I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I was your only man\n\nAnd she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control\n\n\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\n\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\n\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\n\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\n\n\n\nWell, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo\n\nWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside of town about a mile\n\nRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust\n\nShe said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”\n\n\n\nThen she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bummin’ a ride back to from where she started\n\nBut ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up\n\nShe said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could tell she was so broken hearted\n\nShe said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”\n\n\n\n“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh\n\n“We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn\n\n’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”\n\nRuby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”\n\n\n\nSomething about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head\n\nBut I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play\n\nAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved\n\nAnd a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way\n\n\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,\n\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\n\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\n\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\n\n\n\nWell, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour\n\nI was crossin’ the street when shots rang out\n\nI didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran\n\n“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout\n\n\n\nWell, you saw my picture in the <i>Corpus Christi Tribune</i>. Underneath it,\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it said, “A man with no alibi”\n\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you\n\nThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears\n\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do\n\n\n\nNow I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but sometimes you just find yourself over the line\n\nOh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now\n\nYou know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could feel a whole lot better\n\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how\n\n\n\nWell, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck\n\nYeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind\n\nHe’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about\n\nBut I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line\n\n\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\n\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\n\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\n\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\n\n\n\nYou know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned\n\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter\n\nAnd you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was always too good for this world\n\nJust like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I left behind in the French Quarter\n\n\n\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than people who are most content\n\nI don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone\n\nYou always said people don’t do what they believe in, \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent\n\nAnd I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”\n\n\n\nThere was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice\n\nI don’t remember who I was or where I was bound\n\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he was shot in the back\n\nSeems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down\n\n\n\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls\n\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above\n\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world\n\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1986 by Special Rider Music</p>\n",

    "lyrics": "\nFar between sundown’s finish an’ midnight’s broken toll\n\nWe ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing\n\nAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds\n\nSeeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing\n\nFlashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight\n\nFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\n\nAn’ for each an’ ev’ry underdog soldier in the night\n\nAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n\n\nIn the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\n\nWith faces hidden while the walls were tightening\n\nAs the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain\n\nDissolved into the bells of the lightning\n\nTolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake\n\nTolling for the luckless, the abandoned an’ forsaked\n\nTolling for the outcast, burnin’ constantly at stake\n\nAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n\n\nThrough the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail\n\nThe sky cracked its poems in naked wonder\n\nThat the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze\n\nLeaving only bells of lightning and its thunder\n\nStriking for the gentle, striking for the kind\n\nStriking for the guardians and protectors of the mind\n\nAn’ the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time\n\nAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n\n\nThrough the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\n\nFor the disrobed faceless forms of no position\n\nTolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts\n\nAll down in taken-for-granted situations\n\nTolling for the deaf an’ blind, tolling for the mute\n\nTolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute\n\nFor the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an’ cheated by pursuit\n\nAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n\n\nEven though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flashed\n\nAn’ the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\n\nElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\n\nCondemned to drift or else be kept from drifting\n\nTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\n\nFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\n\nAn’ for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\n\nAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n\n\nStarry-eyed an’ laughing as I recall when we were caught\n\nTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\n\nAs we listened one last time an’ we watched with one last look\n\nSpellbound an’ swallowed ’til the tolling ended\n\nTolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed\n\nFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an’ worse\n\nAn’ for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\n\nAn’ we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1964 by Warner Bros.

He ain’t the guy!”\n\nYes, here’s the story of the Hurricane\n\nThe man the authorities came to blame\n\nFor somethin’ that he never done\n\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\n\nThe champion of the world\n\n\n\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\n\nRubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his name\n\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game\n\nAnd the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame\n\n“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”\n\n“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”\n\n“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”\n\n“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”\n\n“Don’t forget that you are white”\n\n\n\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”\n\nCops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break\n\nWe got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello\n\nNow you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\n\nYou’ll be doin’ society a favor\n\nThat sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver\n\nWe want to put his ass in stir\n\nWe want to pin this triple murder on him\n\nHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim”\n\n\n\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\n\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\n\nIt’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay\n\nAnd when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way\n\nUp to some paradise\n\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\n\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\n\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\n\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\n\n\n\nAll of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance\n\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\n\nThe judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums\n\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\n\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\n\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\n\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\n\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\n\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\n\n\n\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\n\nThe crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?\n\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\n\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\n\nHow can the life of such a man\n\nBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?\n\nTo see him obviously framed\n\nCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land\n\nWhere justice is a game\n\n\n\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\n\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\n\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\n\nAn innocent man in a living hell\n\nThat’s the story of the Hurricane\n\nBut it won’t be over till they clear his name\n\nAnd give him back the time he’s done\n\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\n\nThe champion of the world\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1975 by Ram's Horn Music; renewed 2003 by Ram’s Horn Music</p>\n",

Good old-fashioned war!\n\n\n\nThen the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come\n\nThey ceased to come for about ten months or more\n\nThen a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train\n\nYour son’s a-coming home from the war”\n\n\n\nShe smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around\n\nBut she could not see her soldier son in sight\n\nBut as all the people passed, she saw her son at last\n\nWhen she did she could hardly believe her eyes\n\n\n\nOh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off\n\nAnd he wore a metal brace around his waist\n\nHe whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know\n\nWhile she couldn’t even recognize his face!\n\n\n\nOh! Lord! Not even recognize his face\n\n\n\n“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done\n\nHow is it you come to be this way?”\n\nHe tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move\n\nAnd the mother had to turn her face away\n\n\n\n“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war\n\nYou thought it was the best thing I could do?\n\nI was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud\n\nYou wasn’t there standing in my shoes”\n\n\n\n“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?\n\nI’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’\n\nBut the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close\n\nAnd I saw that his face looked just like mine”\n\n\n\nOh! Lord! Just like mine!\n\n\n\n“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink\n\nThat I was just a puppet in a play\n\nAnd through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke\n\nAnd a cannonball blew my eyes away”\n\n\n\nAs he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock\n\nAt seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand\n\nBut as he turned to go, he called his mother close\n\nAnd he dropped his medals down into her hand\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1963, 1968 by Warner Bros.

    "song": "Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie",
    "lyrics": "\nWhen yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb\n\nWhen you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb\n\nWhen yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace\n\nIn a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race\n\nNo matter what yer doing if you start givin' up\n\nIf the wine don't come to the top of yer cup\n\nIf the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on\n\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\n\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\n\nAnd the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it\n\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long\n\nAnd you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong\n\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day\n\nAnd tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away\n\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'\n\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'\n\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\n\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\n\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'\n\nAnd the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'\n\nAnd the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'\n\nAnd yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'\n\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm\n\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say\n\n\"I never knew it was gonna be this way\n\nWhy didn't they tell me the day I was born\"\n\nAnd you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat\n\nAnd you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet\n\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\n\nAnd the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare\n\nAnd yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying\n\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'\n\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\n\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on the street\n\nAnd yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat\n\nAnd you think yer ears might a been hurt\n\nOr yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt\n\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rush\n\nWhen you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush\n\nAnd all the time you were holdin' three queens\n\nAnd it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean\n\nLike in the middle of Life magazine\n\nBouncin' around a pinball machine\n\nAnd there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying\n\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin'\n\nBut it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\n\nAnd it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed\n\nAnd no matter how you try you just can't say it\n\nAnd yer scared to yer soul  you just might forget it\n\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\n\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\n\nAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\n\nAnd his jaws start closin with you underneath\n\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\n\nAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign\n\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin'\n\nOn this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'\n\nOn this curve I'm hanging\n\nOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking\n\nIn this air I'm inhaling\n\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\n\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\n\nWhat am  I saying, what am I knowing\n\nOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'\n\nOn this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'\n\nIn the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'\n\nIn the words that I'm thinkin'\n\nIn this ocean of hours I'm  all the time drinkin'\n\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\n\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\n\nBut you try with your whole soul best\n\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\n\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\n\nOr make yer heart pound\n\nBut then again you know why they're around\n\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\n\n\"Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping\n\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\n\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'\n\nAnd you can't remember for the best of yer thinking\n\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming\n\nAnd you know that it's something special you're needin'\n\nAnd you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'\n\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding\n\nAnd you need something special\n\nYeah, you need something special all right\n\nYou need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track\n\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back\n\nYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler\n\nThat's been banging and booming and blowing forever\n\nThat knows yer troubles a hundred times over\n\nYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race\n\nThat won't laugh at yer looks\n\nYour voice or your face\n\nAnd by any number of bets in the book\n\nWill be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze\n\nYou need something to open up a new door\n\nTo show you something you seen before\n\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more\n\nYou need something to open your eyes\n\nYou need something to make it known\n\nThat it's you and no one else that owns\n\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting\n\nThat the world ain't got you beat\n\nThat it ain't got you licked\n\nIt can't get you crazy no matter how many\n\nTimes you might get kicked\n\nYou need something special all right\n\nYou need something special to give you hope\n\nBut hope's just a word\n\nThat maybe you said or maybe you heard\n\nOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve\n\n\n\nBut that's what you need man, and you need it bad\n\nAnd yer trouble is you know it too good\n\n\"Cause you look an' you start getting the chills\n\n\n\n\"Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill\n\nAnd it ain't on Macy's window sill\n\nAnd it ain't on no rich kid's road map\n\nAnd it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house\n\nAnd it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ\n\nAnd it ain't on that dimlit stage\n\nWith that half-wit comedian on it\n\nRanting and raving and taking yer money\n\nAnd you thinks it's funny\n\nNo you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club\n\nAnd it ain't in the seats of a supper club\n\nAnd sure as hell you're bound to tell\n\nThat no matter how hard you rub\n\nYou just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub\n\nNo, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you\n\nAnd it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you\n\nAnd it ain't in no cardboard-box house\n\nOr down any movie star's blouse\n\nAnd you can't find it on the golf course\n\nAnd Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus\n\nAnd it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes\n\nAnd it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons\n\nAnd it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices\n\nThat come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'\n\nSayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin\n\nLook at my skin shine, look at my skin glow\n\nLook at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry\n\nWhen you can't even sense if they got any insides\n\nThese people so pretty in their ribbons and bows\n\nNo you'll not now or no other day\n\nFind it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache¥\n\nAnd inside it the people made of molasses\n\nThat every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses\n\nAnd it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies\n\nWho'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny\n\nWho breathe and burp and bend and crack\n\nAnd before you can count from one to ten\n\nDo it all over again but this time behind yer back\n\nMy friend\n\nThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl\n\nAnd play games with each other in their sand-box world\n\nAnd you can't find it either in the no-talent fools\n\nThat run around gallant\n\nAnd make all rules for the ones that got talent\n\nAnd it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do\n\nAnd think they're foolin' you\n\nThe ones who jump on the wagon\n\nJust for a while 'cause they know it's in style\n\nTo get their kicks, get out of it quick\n\nAnd make all kinds of money and chicks\n\nAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat\n\nSayin', \"Christ do I gotta be like that\n\nAin't there no one here that knows where I'm at\n\nAin't there no one here that knows how I feel\n\nGood God Almighty\n\nTHAT STUFF AIN'T REAL\"\n\n\n\nNo but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race\n\nYou can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face\n\nYou gotta look some other place\n\nAnd where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'\n\nWhere do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'\n\nWhere do you look for this oil well gushin'\n\nWhere do you look for this candle that's glowin'\n\nWhere do you look for this hope that you know is there\n\nAnd out there somewhere\n\nAnd your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads\n\nYour eyes can only look through two kinds of windows\n\nYour nose can only smell two kinds of hallways\n\nYou can touch and twist\n\nAnd turn two kinds of doorknobs\n\nYou can either go to the church of your choice\n\nOr you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital\n\nYou'll find God in the church of your choice\n\nYou'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital\n\n\n\nAnd though it's only my opinion\n\nI may be right or wrong\n\nYou'll find them both\n\nIn the Grand Canyon\n\nAt sundown",

    "song": "Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts",
    "lyrics": "\nThe festival was over, the boys were all plannin’ for a fall\n\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drillin’ in the wall\n\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gamblin’ wheel shut down\n\nAnyone with any sense had already left town\n\nHe was standin’ in the doorway lookin’ like the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nHe moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said\n\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doin’ before he turned their heads\n\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\n\n“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”\n\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nBackstage the girls were playin’ five-card stud by the stairs\n\nLily had two queens, she was hopin’ for a third to match her pair\n\nOutside the streets were fillin’ up, the window was open wide\n\nA gentle breeze was blowin’, you could feel it from inside\n\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nBig Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town’s only diamond mine\n\nHe made his usual entrance lookin’ so dandy and so fine\n\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\n\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\n\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\n\nShe slipped in through the side door lookin’ like a queen without a crown\n\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\n\n“Sorry, darlin’, that I’m late,” but he didn’t seem to hear\n\nHe was starin’ into space over at the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\n“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinkin’ to himself\n\n“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”\n\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim\n\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\n\nStarin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\n\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she    smiled\n\nShe’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\n\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\n\nBut she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nThe hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\n\nThe drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\n\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring\n\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\n\nNo, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nRosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife\n\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife\n\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\n\nWas lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died\n\nShe was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nLily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away\n\n“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have known it would someday\n\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint\n\nI’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”\n\nDown the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\n\n“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”\n\nHe went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk\n\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\n\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nLily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch\n\nShe forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much\n\n“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere\n\nBut just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear\n\nJust another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\n\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked\n\nAnd Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised\n\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\n\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\n\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul\n\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\n\nFor one more member who had business back in town\n\nBut they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nThe next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black\n\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\n\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink\n\nThe hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink\n\nThe only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts\n\n\n\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”\n\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\n\nShe was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw\n\nThinkin’ ’bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law\n\nBut most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the Jack of Hearts\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1974 by Ram's Horn Music;

No!\n\nI’m a doctor and it’s true\n\nI’m a clean-cut kid\n\nAnd I been to college, too”\n\n\n\nThen in comes his daughter\n\nWhose name was Rita\n\nShe looked like she stepped out of\n\n<i>La Dolce Vita</i>\n\nI immediately tried to cool it\n\nWith her dad\n\nAnd told him what a\n\nNice, pretty farm he had\n\nHe said, “What do doctors\n\nKnow about farms, pray tell?”\n\nI said, “I was born\n\nAt the bottom of a wishing well”\n\n\n\nWell, by the dirt ’neath my nails\n\nI guess he knew I wouldn’t lie\n\n“I guess you’re tired”\n\nHe said, kinda sly\n\nI said, “Yes, ten thousand miles\n\nToday I drove”\n\nHe said, “I got a bed for you\n\nUnderneath the stove\n\nJust one condition\n\nAnd you go to sleep right now\n\nThat you don’t touch my daughter\n\nAnd in the morning, milk the cow”\n\n\n\nI was sleepin’ like a rat\n\nWhen I heard something jerkin’\n\nThere stood Rita\n\nLookin’ just like Tony Perkins\n\nShe said, “Would you like to take a shower?\n\nI’ll show you up to the door”\n\nI said, “Oh, no! no!\n\nI’ve been through this before”\n\nI knew I had to split\n\nBut I didn’t know how\n\nWhen she said\n\n“Would you like to take that shower, now?”\n\n\n\nWell, I couldn’t leave\n\nUnless the old man chased me out\n\n’Cause I’d already promised\n\nThat I’d milk his cows\n\nI had to say something\n\nTo strike him very weird\n\nSo I yelled out\n\n“I like Fidel Castro and his beard”\n\nRita looked offended\n\nBut she got out of the way\n\nAs he came charging down the stairs\n\nSayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?”\n\n\n\nI said, “I like Fidel Castro\n\nI think you heard me right”\n\nAnd ducked as he swung\n\nAt me with all his might\n\nRita mumbled something\n\n’Bout her mother on the hill\n\nAs his fist hit the icebox\n\nHe said he’s going to kill me\n\nIf I don’t get out the door\n\nIn two seconds flat\n\n“You unpatriotic\n\nRotten doctor Commie rat”\n\n\n\nWell, he threw a <i>Reader’s Digest</i>\n\nAt my head and I did run\n\nI did a somersault\n\nAs I seen him get his gun\n\nAnd crashed through the window\n\nAt a hundred miles an hour\n\nAnd landed fully blast\n\nIn his garden flowers\n\nRita said, “Come back!”\n\nAs he started to load\n\nThe sun was comin’ up\n\nAnd I was runnin’ down the road\n\n\n\nWell, I don’t figure I’ll be back\n\nThere for a spell\n\nEven though Rita moved away\n\nAnd got a job in a motel\n\nHe still waits for me\n\nConstant, on the sly\n\nHe wants to turn me in\n\nTo the F.B.I.\n\nMe, I romp and stomp\n\nThankful as I romp\n\nWithout freedom of speech\n\nI might be in the swamp\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1964 by Warner Bros.

He was supposed to feel bad\n\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\n\n\n\nWell, the chances are against it and the odds are slim\n\nThat he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him\n\n’Cause there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back\n\nAnd a license to kill him is given out to every maniac\n\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\n\n\n\nHe got no allies to really speak of\n\nWhat he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love\n\nHe buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied\n\nBut no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side\n\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\n\n\n\nWell, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace\n\nThey pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease\n\nNow, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep\n\nThey lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep\n\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\n\n\n\nEvery empire that’s enslaved him is gone\n\nEgypt and Rome, even the great Babylon\n\nHe’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand\n\nIn bed with nobody, under no one’s command\n\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\n\n\n\nNow his holiest books have been trampled upon\n\nNo contract he signed was worth what it was written on\n\nHe took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth\n\nTook sickness and disease and he turned it into health\n\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\n\n\n\nWhat’s anybody indebted to him for?\n\nNothin’, they say. He just likes to cause war\n\nPride and prejudice and superstition indeed\n\nThey wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed\n\nHe’s the neighborhood bully\n\n\n\nWhat has he done to wear so many scars?\n\nDoes he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?\n\nNeighborhood bully, standing on the hill\n\nRunning out the clock, time standing still\n\nNeighborhood bully\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1983 by Special Rider Music</p>\n",

Honey, what can I say?\n\nYes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can’t you reach?\n\nI see you kiss her on the cheek ev’rytime she gives a speech\n\nWith her picture books of the pyramid\n\nAnd her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)\n\nYou better talk to her ’bout it\n\nYou’re her lover now\n\n\n\nOh, ev’rybody that cares\n\nIs goin’ up the castle stairs\n\nBut I’m not up in your castle, honey\n\nIt’s true, I just can’t recall\n\nSan Francisco at all\n\nI can’t even remember El Paso, uh, honey\n\nYou never had to be faithful\n\nI didn’t want you to grieve\n\nOh, why was it so hard for you\n\nIf you didn’t want to be with me, just to leave?\n\nNow you stand here while your finger’s goin’ up my sleeve\n\nAn’ you, just what do you do anyway? Ain’t there nothin’ you can say?\n\nShe’ll be standin’ on the bar soon\n\nWith a fish head an’ a harpoon\n\nAn’ a fake beard plastered on her brow\n\nYou’d better do somethin’ quick\n\nShe’s your lover now\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1971 by Dwarf Music; renewed 1999 by Dwarf Music</p>\n",

    "song": "Shelter from the Storm",
    "lyrics": "\n’Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood\n\nWhen blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud\n\nI came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nAnd if I pass this way again, you can rest assured\n\nI’ll always do my best for her, on that I give my word\n\nIn a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nNot a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved\n\nEverything up to that point had been left unresolved\n\nTry imagining a place where it’s always safe and warm\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nI was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail\n\nPoisoned in the bushes an’ blown out on the trail\n\nHunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nSuddenly I turned around and she was standin’ there\n\nWith silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair\n\nShe walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nNow there’s a wall between us, somethin’ there’s been lost\n\nI took too much for granted, got my signals crossed\n\nJust to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nWell, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount\n\nBut nothing really matters much, it’s doom alone that counts\n\nAnd the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nI’ve heard newborn babies wailin’ like a mournin’ dove\n\nAnd old men with broken teeth stranded without love\n\nDo I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nIn a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes\n\nI bargained for salvation an’ they gave me a lethal dose\n\nI offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\n\n\n\nWell, I’m livin’ in a foreign country but I’m bound to cross the line\n\nBeauty walks a razor’s edge, someday I’ll make it mine\n\nIf I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born\n\n“Come in,” she said, “I’ll give you shelter from the storm”\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1974 by Ram's Horn Music; renewed 2002 by Ram’s Horn Music</p>\n",

Stetson hat.\n\n\n\nStack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,\n\nOnly taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.\n\nAll about that John B. Stetson hat.\n\n\n\nSent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come,\n\nJust pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, \"Now what have you done?\"\n\nYou're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee.\"\n\n\n\nSix big horses and a rubber-tired hack,\n\nTaking him to the cemetery, buy they failed to bring him back.\n\nAll about that John B. Stetson hat.\n\n\n\nHawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark.\n\nIt must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.\n\nHe's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.\n\n\n\nHigh police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep.\n\nHigh police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet.\n\nHe's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.\n\n\n\nWell they got old Stack-A-Lee and they laid him right back in jail.\n\nCouldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail\n\nAll about that John B. Stetson hat.\n\n\n\nStack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, \"Jailer, I can't sleep.\n\n'Round my bedside Billy Lyons began to creep.\"\n\nAll about that John B.

    "lyrics": "\nOne time in London I’d gone out for a walk\n\nPast a place called Hyde Park where people talk\n\n’Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view\n\nTo anyone passing by, that’s who they’re talking to\n\n\n\nThere was someone on a platform talking to the folks\n\nAbout the T.V. god and all the pain that it invokes\n\n“It’s too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody’s eyes\n\nIf you’ve never seen one it’s a blessing in disguise”\n\n\n\nI moved in closer, got up on my toes\n\nTwo men in front of me were coming to blows\n\nThe man was saying something ’bout children when they’re young\n\nBeing sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung\n\n\n\n“The news of the day is on all the time\n\nAll the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme\n\nYour mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free\n\nDon’t let an egg get laid in it by something you can’t see”\n\n\n\n“Pray for peace!” he said. You could feel it in the crowd\n\nMy thoughts began to wander. His voice was ringing loud\n\n“It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone\n\nNo one can protect you from it once you turn it on”\n\n\n\n“It will lead you into some strange pursuits\n\nLead you to the land of forbidden fruits\n\nIt will scramble up your head and drag your brain about\n\nSometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out”\n\n\n\n“It’s all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind\n\nAnd when you go back to find it, there’s nothing there to find\n\nEvery time you look at it, your situation’s worse\n\nIf you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse\"\n\n\n\nThe crowd began to riot and they grabbed hold of the man\n\nThere was pushing, there was shoving and everybody ran\n\nThe T.V. crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me\n\nLater on that evening, I watched it on T.V.\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1990 by Special Rider Music</p>\n",

    "lyrics": "\nThe pale moon rose in its glory\n\nOut on the western town\n\nShe told a sad, sad story\n\nOf the great ship that went down\n\n\n\n‘Twas the fourteen day of April\n\nOver the waves she rode\n\nSailing into tomorrow\n\nTo a golden age foretold\n\n\n\nThe night was bright with starlight\n\nThe seas were sharp and clear\n\nMoving through the shadows\n\nThe promised hour was near\n\n\n\nLights were holding steady\n\nGliding over the foam\n\nAll the lords and ladies\n\nHeading for their eternal home\n\n\n\nThe chandeliers were swaying\n\nFrom the balustrades above\n\nThe orchestra was playing\n\nSongs of faded love\n\n\n\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\n\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\n\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\n\nInto the underworld\n\n   \n\nLeo took his sketchbook\n\nHe was often so inclined\n\nHe closed his eyes and painted\n\nThe scenery in his mind\n\n\n\nCupid struck his bosom\n\nAnd broke it with a snap\n\nThe closest woman to him\n\nHe fell into her lap\n\n\n\nHe heard a loud commotion\n\nSomething sounded wrong\n\nHis inner spirit was saying\n\nThat he couldn’t stand here long\n\n\n\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\n\nNo time now to sleep \n\nWater on the quarterdeck\n\nAlready three foot deep\n\n\n\nSmokestack leaning sideways\n\nHeavy feet began to pound\n\nHe walked into the whirlwind\n\nSky spinning all around\n\n\n\nThe ship was going under\n\nThe universe opened wide\n\nThe roll was called up yonder\n\nThe angels turned aside\n\n\n\nLights down in the hallway\n\nFlickering dim and dull\n\nDead bodies already floating\n\nIn the double bottomed hull\n\n\n\nThe engines then exploded\n\nPropellers they failed to start\n\nThe boilers overloaded\n\nThe ship's bow split apart\n\n\n\nPassengers were flying\n\nBackward, forward, far and fast\n\nThey mumbled, fumbled, tumbled\n\nEach one more weary than the last\n\n\n\nThe veil was torn asunder\n\n‘Tween the hours of twelve and one\n\nNo change, no sudden wonder\n\nCould undo what had been done\n\n\n\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\n\nAt fourty-five degrees\n\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\n\nDropping to her knees\n\n\n\nWellington, he was sleeping\n\nHis bed began to slide\n\nHis valiant heart was beating\n\nHe pushed the tables aside\n\n\n\nGlass of shattered crystal\n\nLay scattered ‘round about\n\nHe strapped on both his pistols  \n\nHow long could he hold out?\n\n\n\nHis men and his companions\n\nWere nowhere to be seen\n\nIn silence there he waited for\n\nTime and space to intervene\n\n\n\nThe passageway was narrow\n\nThere was blackness in the air\n\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\n\nHeard voices everywhere\n\n\n\nAlarm bells were ringing\n\nTo hold back the swelling tide\n\nFriends and lovers clinging\n\nTo each other side by side\n\n\n\nMothers and their daughters\n\nDescending down the stairs\n\nJumped into the icy waters\n\nLove and pity sent their prayers\n\n\n\nThe rich man, Mr. Astor\n\nKissed his darling wife\n\nHe had no way of knowing\n\nBe the last trip of his life\n\n\n\nCalvin, Blake and Wilson \n\nGambled in the dark\n\nNot one of them would ever live to\n\nTell the tale of disembark\n\n\n\nBrother rose up against brother\n\nIn every circumstance\n\nThey fought and slaughtered each other\n\nIn a deadly dance\n\n\n\nThey lowered down the lifeboats\n\nFrom the sinking wreck\n\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats\n\nBroken backs and broken necks\n\n\n\nThe bishop left his cabin\n\nTo help all those in need\n\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens\n\nSaid, “The poor are yours to feed.”\n\n\n\nDavey the brothel keeper\n\nCame out, dismissed his girls\n\nSaw the water getting deeper\n\nSaw the changing of his world\n\n\n\nJim Dandy smiled\n\nHe'd never learned to swim\n\nSaw the little crippled child\n\nAnd he gave his seat to him\n\n\n\nHe saw the starlight shining\n\nStreaming from the East\n\nDeath was on the rampage\n\nBut his heart was now at peace\n\n\n\nThey battened down the hatches\n\nBut the hatches wouldn’t hold\n\nThey drowned upon the staircase\n\nOf brass and polished gold\n\n\n\nLeo said to Cleo\n\n“I think I’m going mad.”\n\nBut he'd lost his mind already\n\nWhatever mind he had\n\n\n\nHe tried to block the doorway\n\nTo save all those from harm\n\nBlood from an open wound\n\nPouring down his arm\n\n\n\nPetals fell from flowers\n\n‘Til all of them were gone\n\nIn the long and dreadful hours\n\nThe wizard’s curse played on\n\n\n\nThe host was pouring brandy\n\nHe was going down slow\n\nHe stayed right ‘til the end\n\nHe was the last to go\n\n\n\nThere were many, many others\n\nNameless here forevermore\n\nThey'd never sailed the ocean\n\nOr left their homes before\n\n\n\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\n\nThe damage had been done\n\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\n\nAnd he tried to tell someone\n\n\n\nThe captain, barely breathing\n\nKneeling at the wheel\n\nAbove him and beneath him\n\nFifty thousand tons of steel\n\n\n\nHe looked over at his compass\n\nAnd he gazed into its face\n\nNeedle pointing downward\n\nHe knew he lost the race\n\n\n\nIn the dark illumination\n\nHe remembered bygone years\n\nHe read the Book of Revelation\n\nAnd he filled his cup with tears\n\n\n\nWhen the Reaper’s task had ended\n\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest\n\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor\n\nThe loveliest and the best\n\n\n\nThey waited at the landing\n\nAnd they tried to understand\n\nBut there is no understanding\n\nOn the judgment of God’s hand\n\n\n\nNews came over the wires\n\nAnd struck with deadly force\n\nLove had lost its fires\n\nAll things had run their course\n\n\n\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\n\nOf all things that can be\n\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\n\nInto the deep blue sea\n\n\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright  © 2012 by Special Rider Music</p>\n",

    "lyrics": "\nWell, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\n\nThey were the best of friends\n\nSo when Frankie Lee needed money one day\n\nJudas quickly pulled out a roll of tens\n\nAnd placed them on a footstool\n\nJust above the plotted plain\n\nSayin’, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy\n\nMy loss will be your gain”\n\n\n\nWell, Frankie Lee, he sat right down\n\nAnd put his fingers to his chin\n\nBut with the cold eyes of Judas on him\n\nHis head began to spin\n\n“Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said\n\n“It’s just my foolish pride\n\nBut sometimes a man must be alone\n\nAnd this is no place to hide”\n\n\n\nWell, Judas, he just winked and said\n\n“All right, I’ll leave you here\n\nBut you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want\n\nBefore they all disappear”\n\n“I’m gonna start my pickin’ right now\n\nJust tell me where you’ll be”\n\nJudas pointed down the road\n\nAnd said, “Eternity!”\n\n\n\n“Eternity?” said Frankie Lee\n\nWith a voice as cold as ice\n\n“That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity\n\nThough you might call it ‘Paradise’”\n\n“I don’t call it anything”\n\nSaid Frankie Lee with a smile\n\n“All right,” said Judas Priest\n\n“I’ll see you after a while”\n\n\n\nWell, Frankie Lee, he sat back down\n\nFeelin’ low and mean\n\nWhen just then a passing stranger\n\nBurst upon the scene\n\nSaying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler\n\nWhose father is deceased?\n\nWell, if you are, there’s a fellow callin’ you down the road\n\nAnd they say his name is Priest”\n\n\n\n“Oh, yes, he is my friend”\n\nSaid Frankie Lee in fright\n\n“I do recall him very well\n\nIn fact, he just left my sight”\n\n“Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger\n\nAs quiet as a mouse\n\n“Well, my message is, he’s down the road\n\nStranded in a house”\n\n\n\nWell, Frankie Lee, he panicked\n\nHe dropped ev’rything and ran\n\nUntil he came up to the spot\n\nWhere Judas Priest did stand\n\n“What kind of house is this,” he said\n\n“Where I have come to roam?”\n\n“It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest\n\n“It’s not a house . . . it’s a home”\n\n\n\nWell, Frankie Lee, he trembled\n\nHe soon lost all control\n\nOver ev’rything which he had made\n\nWhile the mission bells did toll\n\nHe just stood there staring\n\nAt that big house as bright as any sun\n\nWith four and twenty windows\n\nAnd a woman’s face in ev’ry one\n\n\n\nWell, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee\n\nWith a soulful, bounding leap\n\nAnd, foaming at the mouth\n\nHe began to make his midnight creep\n\nFor sixteen nights and days he raved\n\nBut on the seventeenth he burst\n\nInto the arms of Judas Priest\n\nWhich is where he died of thirst\n\n\n\nNo one tried to say a thing\n\nWhen they took him out in jest\n\nExcept, of course, the little neighbor boy\n\nWho carried him to rest\n\nAnd he just walked along, alone\n\nWith his guilt so well concealed\n\nAnd muttered underneath his breath\n\n“Nothing is revealed”\n\n\n\nWell, the moral of the story\n\nThe moral of this song\n\nIs simply that one should never be\n\nWhere one does not belong\n\nSo when you see your neighbor carryin’ somethin’\n\nHelp him with his load\n\nAnd don’t go mistaking Paradise\n\nFor that home across the road\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1968 by Dwarf Music; renewed 1996 by Dwarf Music</p>\n",

    "lyrics": "\n’Twas down in Mississippi not so long ago\n\nWhen a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door\n\nThis boy’s dreadful tragedy I can still remember well\n\nThe color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till\n\n\n\nSome men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up\n\nThey said they had a reason, but I can’t remember what\n\nThey tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat\n\nThere were screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out on the street\n\n\n\nThen they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain\n\nAnd they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain\n\nThe reason that they killed him there, and I’m sure it ain’t no lie\n\nWas just for the fun of killin’ him and to watch him slowly die\n\n\n\nAnd then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial\n\nTwo brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till\n\nBut on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awful crime\n\nAnd so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind\n\n\n\nI saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see\n\nThe smiling brothers walkin’ down the courthouse stairs\n\nFor the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free\n\nWhile Emmett’s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea\n\n\n\nIf you can’t speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that’s so unjust\n\nYour eyes are filled with dead men’s dirt, your mind is filled with dust\n\nYour arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must refuse to flow\n\nFor you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!\n\n\n\nThis song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man\n\nThat this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan\n\nBut if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give\n\nWe could make this great land of ours a greater place to live\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1963, 1968 by Warner Bros.

    "song": "Tin Angel",
    "lyrics": "\nIt was late last night when the boss came home\n\nTo a deserted mansion and a desolate throne\n\nServant said, “Boss, the lady’s gone\n\nShe left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”\n\n\n\n“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man. \n\nCome to the point as straight as you can.”\n\n“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan, \n\nCame riding through the woods and took her by the hand.” \n\n\n\nThe boss he laid back flat on his bed\n\nHe cursed the heat and he clutched his head\n\nHe pondered the future of his fate \n\nTo wait another day would be far too late\n\n\n\n\"Go fetch me my coat and my tie\n\nAnd the cheapest labor that money can buy\n\nSaddle me up my buckskin mare\n\nIf you see me go by, put up a prayer.\"\n\n\n\nWell, they rode all night and they rode all day\n\nEastward long on the broad highway \n\nHis spirit was tired and his vision was bent\n\nHis men deserted him and onward he went\n\n\n\nHe came to a place where the light was dull\n\nHis forehead pounding in his skull\n\nHeavy heart was wracked with pain\n\nInsomnia raging in his brain\n\n\n\nWell he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword\n\nHe renounced his faith, he denied his Lord\n\nCrawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall\n\nOne way or another he'd put an end to it all\n\n\n\nHe leaned down, cut the electric wire \n\nStared into the flames and he snorted the fire\n\nPeered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two\n\nIt was hard to tell for certain who was who\n\n\n\nHe lowered himself down on a golden chain\n\nHis nerves were quaking in every vein\n\nHis knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air\n\nHe ran his fingers through his greasy hair\n\n\n\nThey looked at each other and their glasses clinked\n\nOne single unit inseparably linked \n\n“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by.”\n\n“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly.”\n\n\n\nFrom behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor\n\nHe moved his feet and he bolted the door\n\nShadows hiding the lines in his face\n\nWith all the nobility of an ancient race\n\n\n\nShe turned, she was startled with a look of surprise\n\nWith a hatred that could hit the skies\n\n“You’re a reckless fool, I can see it in your eyes.\n\nTo come this way was by no means wise.”\n\n\n\n“Get up, stand up, you greedy lipped wench\n\nAnd cover your face or suffer the consequence.\n\nYou are making my heart full sick.\n\nPut your clothes back on double quick.”\n\n\n\n“Silly boy, you think me a saint.\n\nI’ll listen no more to your words of complaint.\n\nYou’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies.\n\nNow hold your tongue and feed your eyes.”\n\n\n\n“I’d have given you the stars and the planets too\n\nBut what good would these things do you?\n\nBow the heart, if not the knee\n\nOr never again this world you’ll see.”\n\n\n\n “Oh, please let not your heart be cold.\n\nThis man is dearer to me than gold.”\n\n“Oh my dear, you must be blind.\n\nHe’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind.”\n\n\n\n“You had your way too long with me.\n\nNow it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be.\n\nTry to escape,” he cussed and cursed\n\n“You’ll have to try to get past me first.”\n\n\n\n“I dare not let your passion rule.\n\nYou think my heart, the heart of a fool.\n\nAnd you sir, you cannot deny \n\nYou made a monkey of me, what and for why?”\n\n\n\n“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat.\n\nThe devil can have you, I’ll see to that.\n\nLook sharp or step aside,\n\nOr in the cradle you’ll wish you died.”\n\n\n\nThe gun went boom and the shot rang clear\n\nFirst bullet grazed his ear\n\nSecond ball went right straight in\n\nAnd he bent in the middle like a twisted pin\n\n\n\nHe crawled to the corner and he lowered his head\n\nHe gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed\n\nIt would take more than needle and thread\n\nBleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead\n\n\n\n“You shot my husband down, you fiend.”\n\n“Husband, what husband, what the hell do you mean?\n\nHe was a man of strife, a man of sin.\n\nI cut him down and I’ll throw him to the wind.”\n\n\n\n“Hear this,” she said, with angry breath\n\n“You too shall meet the lord of death.\n\nIt was I who brought your soul to life.”\n\nAnd she raised her robe and she drew out a knife\n\n\n\nHis face was hard and caked with sweat\n\nHis arms ached and his hands were wet\n\n“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.\n\nIf you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife.”\n\n\n\n“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot.\n\nBut we’re no way similar in body and thought.\n\nAll husbands are good men, as all wives know.”\n\nThen she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow\n\n\n\nHis knees went limp and he reached for the door\n\nHis doom was sealed, he slid to the floor\n\nHe whispered in her ear, “This is all your fault.\n\nMy fighting days have come to a halt.”\n\n\n\nShe touched his lip and kissed his cheek\n\nHe tried to speak, but his breath was weak\n\n“You died for me, now I'll die for you.”\n\nShe put the blade to her heart and she ran it through\n\n\n\nAll three lovers together in a heap\n\nThrown into the grave forever to sleep\n\nFuneral torches blazed away\n\nThrough the towns and the villages all night and all day\n\n\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright  © 2012 by Special Rider Music</p>\n",
