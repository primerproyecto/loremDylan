    "lyrics": " I crossed the green mountain, I slept by the stream Heaven blazin’ in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream Something came up out of the seaSwept through the land of the rich and the freeI look into the eyes of my merciful friendAnd then I ask myself, is this the end? Memories linger, sad yet sweetAnd I think of the souls in heaven who will meetAltars are burning with flames falling wideThe foe has crossed over from the other sideThey tip their caps from the top of the hillYou can feel them come, more brave blood to spillAlong the dim Atlantic lineThe ravaged land lies for miles behindThe light’s comin’ forward and the streets are broad All must yield to the avenging GodThe world is old, the world is grayLessons of life can’t be learned in a dayI watch and I wait and I listen while I standTo the music that comes from a far better landClose the eyes of our Captain, peace may he know His long night is done, the great leader is laid low He was ready to fall, he was quick to defendKilled outright he was by his own menIt’s the last day’s last hour of the last happy year I feel that the unknown world is so nearPride will vanish and glory will rotBut virtue lives and cannot be forgotThe bells of evening have rungThere’s blasphemy on every tongueLet them say that I walked in fair nature’s light And that I was loyal to truth and to rightServe God and be cheerful, look upward beyondBeyond the darkness that masks the surprises of dawnIn the deep green grasses of the blood stained woodThey never dreamed of surrendering. They fell where they stoodStars fell over Alabama, I saw each starYou’re walkin’ in dreams whoever you are Chilled are the skies, keen is the frostThe ground’s froze hard and the morning is lostA letter to mother came todayGunshot wound to the breast is what it did say But he’ll be better soon he’s in a hospital bed But he’ll never be better, he’s already deadI’m ten miles outside the city and I’m lifted awayIn an ancient light that is not of dayThey were calm, they were blunt, we knew ’em all too well We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell 2002 ",

Oh, AngelinaHis eyes were two slits that would make a snake proudWith a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowdWorshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowedAnd the head of a hyenaDo I need your permission to turn the other cheek?If you can read my mind, why must I speak?No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seekAngelinaOh, Angelina. Oh, AngelinaIn the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explodeThe peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowedI was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the roadWith your subpoenaWhen you cease to exist, then who will you blameI’ve tried my best to love you but I cannot play this gameYour best friend and my worst enemy is one and the sameAngelinaOh, Angelina. Oh, AngelinaThere’s a black Mercedes rollin’ through the combat zoneYour servants are half dead, you’re down to the boneTell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrownMaybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?She was stolen from her mother when she was three days oldNow her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been soldHe’s surrounded by God’s angels and she’s wearin’ a blindfoldAnd so are you, AngelinaOh, Angelina. Oh, AngelinaI see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by forceI can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horseIn God’s truth tell me what you want and you’ll have it of courseJust step into the arenaBeat a path of retreat up them spiral staircasesPass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four facesBegging God for mercy and weepin’ in unholy placesAngelinaOh, Angelina.

    "lyrics": "While riding on a train goin’ westI fell asleep for to take my restI dreamed a dream that made me sadConcerning myself and the first few friends I hadWith half-damp eyes I stared to the roomWhere my friends and I spent many an afternoonWhere we together weathered many a stormLaughin’ and singin’ till the early hours of the mornBy the old wooden stove where our hats was hungOur words were told, our songs were sungWhere we longed for nothin’ and were quite satisfiedTalkin’ and a-jokin’ about the world outsideWith haunted hearts through the heat and coldWe never thought we could ever get oldWe thought we could sit forever in funBut our chances really was a million to oneAs easy it was to tell black from whiteIt was all that easy to tell wrong from rightAnd our choices were few and the thought never hitThat the one road we traveled would ever shatter and splitHow many a year has passed and goneAnd many a gamble has been lost and wonAnd many a road taken by many a friendAnd each one I’ve never seen againI wish, I wish, I wish in vainThat we could sit simply in that room againTen thousand dollars at the drop of a hatI’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that 1963, 1964 by Warner Bros.

    "song": "Brownsville Girl",
    "lyrics": "Well, there was this movie I seen one timeAbout a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory PeckHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himselfThe townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neckWell, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulpAs the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and squareI want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling inAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chainYou know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apartThe memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ trainI can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desertIn your busted down Ford and your platform heelsI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meetAh, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheelWell, we drove that car all night into San Anton’And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and softWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came backI would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown offWell, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the RockiesNow I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soulBut I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I was your only manAnd she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of controlBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curlsTeeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the worldBrownsville girl, you’re my honey loveWell, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards AmarilloWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside of town about a mileRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dustShe said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bummin’ a ride back to from where she startedBut ya know, she changed the subject every time money came upShe said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could tell she was so broken heartedShe said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh“We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my headBut I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to playAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people movedAnd a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my wayBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,Teeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the worldBrownsville girl, you’re my honey loveWell, they were looking for somebody with a pompadourI was crossin’ the street when shots rang outI didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shoutWell, you saw my picture in the <i>Corpus Christi Tribune</i>. Underneath it,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it said, “A man with no alibi”You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with youThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tearsIt was the best acting I saw anybody doNow I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but sometimes you just find yourself over the lineOh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right nowYou know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could feel a whole lot betterIf you were just here by my side to show me howWell, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory PeckYeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mindHe’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s aboutBut I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in lineBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curlsTeeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the worldBrownsville girl, you’re my honey loveYou know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em plannedThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that his name wasn’t Henry PorterAnd you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was always too good for this worldJust like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I left behind in the French QuarterStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than people who are most contentI don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m goneYou always said people don’t do what they believe in, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they just do what’s most convenient, then they repentAnd I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twiceI don’t remember who I was or where I was boundAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he was shot in the backSeems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn downBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curlsTeeth like pearls shining like the moon aboveBrownsville girl, show me all around the worldBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love 1986 ",

    "lyrics": "She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lostFrom the city of seven hills near the place of the crossI was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedyTold about Jesus, told about the rainShe told me about the jungle where her brothers were slainBy a man who danced on the roof of the embassyWas she a child or a woman, I can’t say whichFrom one to another she could easily switchWe went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reachCould I been used and played as a pawn?It certainly was possible as the gay night wore onWhere men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speechAnd them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to MexicoFanning the flames in the furnace of desireAnd them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and freeBringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fireShe looked into my soul through the clothes that I woreShe said, “We got a mutual friend over by the doorAnd you know he’s got our best interest in mind”He was well connected but her heart was a snareAnd she had left him to die in thereThere were payments due and he was a little behindThe cry of the peacock, flies buzz my headCeiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bedStreet band playing “Nearer My God to Thee”We met at the steeple where the mission bells ringShe said, “I know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thingYou can do about it, so let us just agree to agree”And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to MexicoFanning the flames in the furnace of desireAnd them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and freeBringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fireAtlantic City by the cold grey seaI hear a voice crying, “Daddy,” I always think it’s for meBut it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that callEvery new messenger brings evil report’Bout armies on the march and time that is shortAnd famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon wallsWould I have married her? I don’t know, I supposeShe had bells in her braids and they hung to her toesBut I kept hearing my name and had to be movin’ onI saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tinI saw a house in the country being torn from withinI heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyondAnd them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to MexicoFanning the flames in the furnace of desireAnd them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and freeBringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire 1985 ",

You can have my chairI can’t see us goin’ anywhere, girlThe only place open is a thousand miles away and I can’t take you thereI wish I’d have been a doctorMaybe I’d have saved some life that had been lostMaybe I’d have done some good in the world’Stead of burning every bridge I crossedDon’t fall apart on me tonightI just don’t think that I could handle itDon’t fall apart on me tonightYesterday’s just a memoryTomorrow is never what it’s supposed to beAnd I need you, oh, yeahI ain’t too good at conversation, girlSo you might not know exactly how I feelBut if I could, I’d bring you to the mountaintop, girlAnd build you a house made out of stainless steelBut it’s like I’m stuck inside a paintingThat’s hanging in the LouvreMy throat start to tickle and my nose itchesBut I know that I can’t moveDon’t fall apart on me tonightI just don’t think that I could handle itDon’t fall apart on me tonightYesterday’s gone but the past lives onTomorrow’s just one step beyondAnd I need you, oh, yeahWho are these people who are walking towards you?Do you know them or will there be a fight?With their humorless smiles so easy to see throughCan they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?Do you remember St. James StreetWhere you blew Jackie P.’s mind?You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feetAnd laid his life on the lineLet’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girlNo more booby traps and bombsNo more decadence and charmNo more affection that’s misplaced, girlNo more mudcake creatures lying in your armsWhat about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?He looked so baffled and so bewilderedWhen he played and we didn’t danceDon’t fall apart on me tonightI just don’t think that I could handle itDon’t fall apart on me tonightYesterday’s just a memoryTomorrow is never what it’s supposed to beAnd I need you, yeah 1983 ",

    "lyrics": "Of war and peace the truth just twistsIts curfew gull just glidesUpon four-legged forest cloudsThe cowboy angel ridesWith his candle lit into the sunThough its glow is waxed in blackAll except when ’neath the trees of EdenThe lamppost stands with folded armsIts iron claws attachedTo curbs ’neath holes where babies wailThough it shadows metal badgeAll and all can only fallWith a crashing but meaningless blowNo sound ever comes from the Gates of EdenThe savage soldier sticks his head in sandAnd then complainsUnto the shoeless hunter who’s gone deafBut still remainsUpon the beach where hound dogs bayAt ships with tattooed sailsHeading for the Gates of EdenWith a time-rusted compass bladeAladdin and his lampSits with Utopian hermit monksSidesaddle on the Golden CalfAnd on their promises of paradiseYou will not hear a laughAll except inside the Gates of EdenRelationships of ownershipThey whisper in the wingsTo those condemned to act accordinglyAnd wait for succeeding kingsAnd I try to harmonize with songsThe lonesome sparrow singsThere are no kings inside the Gates of EdenThe motorcycle black madonnaTwo-wheeled gypsy queenAnd her silver-studded phantom causeThe gray flannel dwarf to screamAs he weeps to wicked birds of preyWho pick up on his bread crumb sinsAnd there are no sins inside the Gates of EdenThe kingdoms of ExperienceIn the precious wind they rotWhile paupers change possessionsEach one wishing for what the other has gotAnd the princess and the princeDiscuss what’s real and what is notIt doesn’t matter inside the Gates of EdenThe foreign sun, it squints uponA bed that is never mineAs friends and other strangersFrom their fates try to resignLeaving men wholly, totally freeTo do anything they wish to do but dieAnd there are no trials inside the Gates of EdenAt dawn my lover comes to meAnd tells me of her dreamsWith no attempts to shovel the glimpseInto the ditch of what each one meansAt times I think there are no wordsBut these to tell what’s trueAnd there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden 1965 by Warner Bros.

    "lyrics": "There is a house down in New Orleans they call the rising sunAnd it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me, oh God, I'm one.My mother was a tailor, she sowed these new blue jeansMy sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunkAnd the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards aroundAnd the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to townOh tell my baby sister not to do what I have doneBut shun that house in New Orleans they call the rising sun.Well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the trainI'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.I'm going back to New Orleans, my race is almost runI'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun.There is a house in New Orleans they call the rising sunAnd it's been the ruin of many a poor girl and me, oh God, I'm one.1978 MCA",

    "lyrics": "Pistol shots ring out in the barroom nightEnter Patty Valentine from the upper hallShe sees the bartender in a pool of bloodCries out, “My God, they killed them all!”Here comes the story of the HurricaneThe man the authorities came to blameFor somethin’ that he never donePut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a beenThe champion of the worldThree bodies lyin’ there does Patty seeAnd another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understandI saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops“One of us had better call up the cops”And so Patty calls the copsAnd they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’In the hot New Jersey nightMeanwhile, far away in another part of townRubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ aroundNumber one contender for the middleweight crownHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go downWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the roadJust like the time before and the time before thatIn Paterson that’s just the way things goIf you’re black you might as well not show up on the street’Less you wanna draw the heatAlfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the copsHim and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ aroundHe said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweightsThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her headCop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”So they took him to the infirmaryAnd though this man could hardly seeThey told him that he could identify the guilty menFour in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin inTake him to the hospital and they bring him upstairsThe wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eyeSays, “Wha’d you bring him in here for? He ain’t the guy!”Yes, here’s the story of the HurricaneThe man the authorities came to blameFor somethin’ that he never donePut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a beenThe champion of the worldFour months later, the ghettos are in flameRubin’s in South America, fightin’ for his nameWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery gameAnd the cops are puttin’ the screws to him, lookin’ for somebody to blame“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?”“Don’t forget that you are white”Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a breakWe got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend BelloNow you don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellowYou’ll be doin’ society a favorThat sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braverWe want to put his ass in stirWe want to pin this triple murder on himHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim”Rubin could take a man out with just one punchBut he never did like to talk about it all that muchIt’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for payAnd when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my wayUp to some paradiseWhere the trout streams flow and the air is niceAnd ride a horse along a trailBut then they took him to the jailhouseWhere they try to turn a man into a mouseAll of Rubin’s cards were marked in advanceThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chanceThe judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slumsTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bumAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy niggerNo one doubted that he pulled the triggerAnd though they could not produce the gunThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deedAnd the all-white jury agreedRubin Carter was falsely triedThe crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?Bello and Bradley and they both baldly liedAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the rideHow can the life of such a manBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?To see him obviously framedCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a landWhere justice is a gameNow all the criminals in their coats and their tiesAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun riseWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cellAn innocent man in a living hellThat’s the story of the HurricaneBut it won’t be over till they clear his nameAnd give him back the time he’s donePut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a beenThe champion of the world 1975 by Ram's Horn Music; renewed 2003 by Ram’s Horn Music",

    "lyrics": "Went out last night to take a little round.I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.I ran right home and I went to bedWith a forty-four smokeless under my head.I began to think what a deed I'd done.I grabbed my hat and I began to run.I made a god run but I ran too slow;  They overtook me down in JerichoStanding on a corner a ringin' my bell,Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.He said 'Young man is you name Brown?Remember you blowed Sadie down.\"\"Oh yes sir, my name is Lee.I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.First degree and second degree.If  you've got any papers will you serve them to me?\"Well they took me down town  and they dressed me in black,They put me on a train and they sent me back.I had no one to go my bail;They crammed me back into the county jail.Oh, yes they did.The judge and the jury they took their stand.The judge had the papers in his right hand.Forty-one days, forty-one nights;Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes;Oh, no!Went out last night to take a little round.I met little Sadie and I blowed her down.I ran right home and I went to bed,A forty-four smokeless under my head. 1970 by Big Sky Music",

    "lyrics": "John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shoreHis mama sure was proud of him!He stood straight and tall in his uniform and allHis mama’s face broke out all in a grin“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mineYou make me proud to know you hold a gunDo what the captain says, lots of medals you will getAnd we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shoutTellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”She made well sure her neighbors understoodShe got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smileAs she showed them to the people from next doorAnd she bragged about her son with his uniform and gunAnd these things you called a good old-fashioned warOh! Good old-fashioned war!Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not comeThey ceased to come for about ten months or moreThen a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the trainYour son’s a-coming home from the war”She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere aroundBut she could not see her soldier son in sightBut as all the people passed, she saw her son at lastWhen she did she could hardly believe her eyesOh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown offAnd he wore a metal brace around his waistHe whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not knowWhile she couldn’t even recognize his face!Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they doneHow is it you come to be this way?”He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly moveAnd the mother had to turn her face away“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to warYou thought it was the best thing I could do?I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proudYou wasn’t there standing in my shoes”“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came closeAnd I saw that his face looked just like mine”Oh! Lord! Just like mine!“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stinkThat I was just a puppet in a playAnd through the roar and smoke, this string is finally brokeAnd a cannonball blew my eyes away”As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shockAt seein’ the metal brace that helped him standBut as he turned to go, he called his mother closeAnd he dropped his medals down into her hand 1963, 1968 by Warner Bros.

life's busy raceNo matter what yer doing if you start givin' upIf the wine don't come to the top of yer cupIf the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' onAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is goneAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch itAnd the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch itAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too longAnd you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrongAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the dayAnd tomorrow's mornin' seems so far awayAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleysTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleysAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of stormAnd to yourself you sometimes say\"I never knew it was gonna be this wayWhy didn't they tell me the day I was born\"And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweatAnd you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yetAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the airAnd the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stareAnd yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flyingAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feetAnd you need it badly but it lays on the streetAnd yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beatAnd you think yer ears might a been hurtOr yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirtAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rushWhen you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flushAnd all the time you were holdin' three queensAnd it's makin you mad, it's makin' you meanLike in the middle of Life magazineBouncin' around a pinball machineAnd there's something on yer mind you wanna be sayingThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin'But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer headAnd it bothers you badly when your layin' in bedAnd no matter how you try you just can't say itAnd yer scared to yer soul  you just might forget itAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer headAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of leadAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teethAnd his jaws start closin with you underneathAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behindAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour signAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin'On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'On this curve I'm hangingOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm takingIn this air I'm inhalingAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hardWhy am I walking, where am I runningWhat am  I saying, what am I knowingOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'In the words that I'm thinkin'In this ocean of hours I'm  all the time drinkin'Who am I helping, what am I breakingWhat am I giving, what am I takingBut you try with your whole soul bestNever to think these thoughts and never to letThem kind of thoughts gain groundOr make yer heart poundBut then again you know why they're aroundJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\"Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creepingAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleepingAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'And you can't remember for the best of yer thinkingIf that was you in the dream that was screamingAnd you know that it's something special you're needin'And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleedingAnd you need something specialYeah, you need something special all rightYou need a fast flyin' train on a tornado trackTo shoot you someplace and shoot you backYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howlerThat's been banging and booming and blowing foreverThat knows yer troubles a hundred times overYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no raceThat won't laugh at yer looksYour voice or your faceAnd by any number of bets in the bookWill be rollin' long after the bubblegum crazeYou need something to open up a new doorTo show you something you seen beforeBut overlooked a hundred times or moreYou need something to open your eyesYou need something to make it knownThat it's you and no one else that ownsThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sittingThat the world ain't got you beatThat it ain't got you lickedIt can't get you crazy no matter how manyTimes you might get kickedYou need something special all rightYou need something special to give you hopeBut hope's just a wordThat maybe you said or maybe you heardOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curveBut that's what you need man, and you need it badAnd yer trouble is you know it too good\"Cause you look an' you start getting the chills\"Cause you can't find it on a dollar billAnd it ain't on Macy's window sillAnd it ain't on no rich kid's road mapAnd it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity houseAnd it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germAnd it ain't on that dimlit stageWith that half-wit comedian on itRanting and raving and taking yer moneyAnd you thinks it's funnyNo you can't find it in no night club or no yacht clubAnd it ain't in the seats of a supper clubAnd sure as hell you're bound to tellThat no matter how hard you rubYou just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stubNo, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' youAnd it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' youAnd it ain't in no cardboard-box houseOr down any movie star's blouseAnd you can't find it on the golf courseAnd Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa ClausAnd it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothesAnd it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goonsAnd it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voicesThat come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skinLook at my skin shine, look at my skin glowLook at my skin laugh, look at my skin cryWhen you can't even sense if they got any insidesThese people so pretty in their ribbons and bowsNo you'll not now or no other dayFind it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache¥And inside it the people made of molassesThat every other day buy a new pair of sunglassesAnd it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phoniesWho'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a pennyWho breathe and burp and bend and crackAnd before you can count from one to tenDo it all over again but this time behind yer backMy friendThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirlAnd play games with each other in their sand-box worldAnd you can't find it either in the no-talent foolsThat run around gallantAnd make all rules for the ones that got talentAnd it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they doAnd think they're foolin' youThe ones who jump on the wagonJust for a while 'cause they know it's in styleTo get their kicks, get out of it quickAnd make all kinds of money and chicksAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hatSayin', \"Christ do I gotta be like

Lo and behold!Lookin’ for my lo and beholdGet me outa here, my dear man!I come into PittsburghAt six-thirty flatI found myself a vacant seatAn’ I put down my hat“What’s the matter, Molly, dearWhat’s the matter with your mound?”“What’s it to ya, Moby Dick?This is chicken town!”Lo and behold! Lo and behold!Lookin’ for my lo and beholdGet me outa here, my dear man!I bought my girlA herd of mooseOne she could call her ownWell, she came out the very next dayTo see where they had flownI’m goin’ down to TennesseeGet me a truck ‘r somethin’Gonna save my money and rip it up!Lo and behold! Lo and behold!Lookin’ for my lo and beholdGet me outa here, my dear man!Now, I come in on a Ferris wheelAn’ boys, I sure was slickI come in like a ton of bricksLaid a few tricks on ’emGoin’ back to PittsburghCount up to thirtyRound that horn and ride that herdGonna thread up!Lo and behold!

Do it nowTomorrow all activity will ceaseYou know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peaceSomewhere Mama’s weeping for her blue-eyed boyShe’s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toyAnd he’s following a starThe same one them three men followed from the EastI hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace 1983 ",

    "lyrics": "I pounded on a farmhouseLookin’ for a place to stayI was mighty, mighty tiredI had come a long, long wayI said, “Hey, hey, in thereIs there anybody home?”I was standin’ on the stepsFeelin’ most aloneWell, out comes a farmerHe must have thought that I was nutsHe immediately looked at meAnd stuck a gun into my gutsI fell downTo my bended kneesSaying, “I dig farmersDon’t shoot me, please!”He cocked his rifleAnd began to shout“You’re that travelin’ salesmanThat I have heard about”I said, “No! No! No!I’m a doctor and it’s trueI’m a clean-cut kidAnd I been to college, too”Then in comes his daughterWhose name was RitaShe looked like she stepped out of<i>La Dolce Vita</i>I immediately tried to cool itWith her dadAnd told him what aNice, pretty farm he hadHe said, “What do doctorsKnow about farms, pray tell?”I said, “I was bornAt the bottom of a wishing well”Well, by the dirt ’neath my nailsI guess he knew I wouldn’t lie“I guess you’re tired”He said, kinda slyI said, “Yes, ten thousand milesToday I drove”He said, “I got a bed for youUnderneath the stoveJust one conditionAnd you go to sleep right nowThat you don’t touch my daughterAnd in the morning, milk the cow”I was sleepin’ like a ratWhen I heard something jerkin’There stood RitaLookin’ just like Tony PerkinsShe said, “Would you like to take a shower?I’ll show you up to the door”I said, “Oh, no! no!I’ve been through this before”I knew I had to splitBut I didn’t know howWhen she said“Would you like to take that shower, now?”Well, I couldn’t leaveUnless the old man chased me out’Cause I’d already promisedThat I’d milk his cowsI had to say somethingTo strike him very weirdSo I yelled out“I like Fidel Castro and his beard”Rita looked offendedBut she got out of the wayAs he came charging down the stairsSayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?”I said, “I like Fidel CastroI think you heard me right”And ducked as he swungAt me with all his mightRita mumbled something’Bout her mother on the hillAs his fist hit the iceboxHe said he’s going to kill meIf I don’t get out the doorIn two seconds flat“You unpatrioticRotten doctor Commie rat”Well, he threw a <i>Reader’s Digest</i>At my head and I did runI did a somersaultAs I seen him get his gunAnd crashed through the windowAt a hundred miles an hourAnd landed fully blastIn his garden flowersRita said, “Come back!”As he started to loadThe sun was comin’ upAnd I was runnin’ down the roadWell, I don’t figure I’ll be backThere for a spellEven though Rita moved awayAnd got a job in a motelHe still waits for meConstant, on the slyHe wants to turn me inTo the F.B.I.Me, I romp and stompThankful as I rompWithout freedom of speechI might be in the swamp 1964 by Warner Bros.

He was supposed to feel badHe’s the neighborhood bullyWell, the chances are against it and the odds are slimThat he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him’Cause there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his backAnd a license to kill him is given out to every maniacHe’s the neighborhood bullyHe got no allies to really speak ofWhat he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of loveHe buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be deniedBut no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his sideHe’s the neighborhood bullyWell, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peaceThey pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must ceaseNow, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weepThey lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleepHe’s the neighborhood bullyEvery empire that’s enslaved him is goneEgypt and Rome, even the great BabylonHe’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sandIn bed with nobody, under no one’s commandHe’s the neighborhood bullyNow his holiest books have been trampled uponNo contract he signed was worth what it was written onHe took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealthTook sickness and disease and he turned it into healthHe’s the neighborhood bullyWhat’s anybody indebted to him for?Nothin’, they say. He just likes to cause warPride and prejudice and superstition indeedThey wait for this bully like a dog waits to feedHe’s the neighborhood bullyWhat has he done to wear so many scars?Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?Neighborhood bully, standing on the hillRunning out the clock, time standing stillNeighborhood bully 1983 ",

Stetson hat.Hawlin Alley, thought I heard the bulldogs bark.It must have been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep.High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, and he jumped forty feet.He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.Well they got old Stack-A-Lee and they laid him right back in jail.Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bailAll about that John B. Stetson hat.Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, \"Jailer, I can't sleep.'Round my bedside Billy Lyons began to creep.\"All about that John B. Stetson hat.1993 Special Rider Music",

Good car to drive after a warWell, I remember seein’ some adSo I turned on my ConelradBut I didn’t pay my Con Ed billSo the radio didn’t work so wellTurned on my record player—It was Rock-a-day Johnny singin’, “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your PaOur Love’s A-gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”I was feelin’ kinda lonesome and blueI needed somebody to talk toSo I called up the operator of timeJust to hear a voice of some kind“When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”She said that for over an hourAnd I hung upWell, the doctor interrupted me just about thenSayin’, “Hey I’ve been havin’ the same old dreamsBut mine was a little different you seeI dreamt that the only person left after the war was meI didn’t see you around”Well, now time passed and now it seemsEverybody’s having them dreamsEverybody sees themselvesWalkin’ around with no one elseHalf of the people can be part right all of the timeSome of the people can be all right part of the timeBut all of the people can’t be all right all of the timeI think Abraham Lincoln said that“I’ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours”I said that 1963, 1966 by Warner Bros.

    "lyrics": "’Twas down in Mississippi not so long agoWhen a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern doorThis boy’s dreadful tragedy I can still remember wellThe color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett TillSome men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him upThey said they had a reason, but I can’t remember whatThey tortured him and did some things too evil to repeatThere were screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out on the streetThen they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rainAnd they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming painThe reason that they killed him there, and I’m sure it ain’t no lieWas just for the fun of killin’ him and to watch him slowly dieAnd then to stop the United States of yelling for a trialTwo brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett TillBut on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awful crimeAnd so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mindI saw the morning papers but I could not bear to seeThe smiling brothers walkin’ down the courthouse stairsFor the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went freeWhile Emmett’s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern seaIf you can’t speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that’s so unjustYour eyes are filled with dead men’s dirt, your mind is filled with dustYour arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must refuse to flowFor you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!This song is just a reminder to remind your fellow manThat this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux KlanBut if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could giveWe could make this great land of ours a greater place to live 1963, 1968 by Warner Bros.

    "lyrics": "Three angels up above the streetEach one playing a hornDressed in green robes with wings that stick outThey’ve been there since Christmas mornThe wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flashThen a lady in a bright orange dressOne U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheelsThe Tenth Avenue bus going westThe dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter aroundA man with a badge skips byThree fellas crawlin’ on their way back to workNobody stops to ask whyThe bakery truck stops outside of that fenceWhere the angels stand high on their polesThe driver peeks out, trying to find one faceIn this concrete world full of soulsThe angels play on their horns all dayThe whole earth in progression seems to pass byBut does anyone hear the music they playDoes anyone even try? 1970 by Big Sky Music; renewed 1998 by Big Sky Music",

    "song": "Tin Angel",
    "lyrics": "It was late last night when the boss came homeTo a deserted mansion and a desolate throneServant said, “Boss, the lady’s goneShe left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man. Come to the point as straight as you can.”“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan, Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand.” The boss he laid back flat on his bedHe cursed the heat and he clutched his headHe pondered the future of his fate To wait another day would be far too late\"Go fetch me my coat and my tieAnd the cheapest labor that money can buySaddle me up my buckskin mareIf you see me go by, put up a prayer.\"Well, they rode all night and they rode all dayEastward long on the broad highway His spirit was tired and his vision was bentHis men deserted him and onward he wentHe came to a place where the light was dullHis forehead pounding in his skullHeavy heart was wracked with painInsomnia raging in his brainWell he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled swordHe renounced his faith, he denied his LordCrawled on his belly, put his ear to the wallOne way or another he'd put an end to it allHe leaned down, cut the electric wire Stared into the flames and he snorted the firePeered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the twoIt was hard to tell for certain who was whoHe lowered himself down on a golden chainHis nerves were quaking in every veinHis knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the airHe ran his fingers through his greasy hairThey looked at each other and their glasses clinkedOne single unit inseparably linked “Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by.”“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly.”From behind the curtain the boss crossed the floorHe moved his feet and he bolted the doorShadows hiding the lines in his faceWith all the nobility of an ancient raceShe turned, she was startled with a look of surpriseWith a hatred that could hit the skies“You’re a reckless fool, I can see it in your eyes.To come this way was by no means wise.”“Get up, stand up, you greedy lipped wenchAnd cover your face or suffer the consequence.You are making my heart full sick.Put your clothes back on double quick.”“Silly boy, you think me a saint.I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint.You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies.Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes.”“I’d have given you the stars and the planets tooBut what good would these things do you?Bow the heart, if not the kneeOr never again this world you’ll see.” “Oh, please let not your heart be cold.This man is dearer to me than gold.”“Oh my dear, you must be blind.He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind.”“You had your way too long with me.Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be.Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed“You’ll have to try to get past me first.”“I dare not let your passion rule.You think my heart, the heart of a fool.And you sir, you cannot deny You made a monkey of me, what and for why?”“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat.The devil can have you, I’ll see to that.Look sharp or step aside,Or in the cradle you’ll wish you died.”The gun went boom and the shot rang clearFirst bullet grazed his earSecond ball went right straight inAnd he bent in the middle like a twisted pinHe crawled to the corner and he lowered his headHe gripped the chair and he grabbed the bedIt would take more than needle and threadBleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead“You shot my husband down, you fiend.”“Husband, what husband, what the hell do you mean?He was a man of strife, a man of sin.I cut him down and I’ll throw him to the wind.”“Hear this,” she said, with angry breath“You too shall meet the lord of death.It was I who brought your soul to life.”And she raised her robe and she drew out a knifeHis face was hard and caked with sweatHis arms ached and his hands were wet“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife.”“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot.But we’re no way similar in body and thought.All husbands are good men, as all wives know.”Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flowHis knees went limp and he reached for the doorHis doom was sealed, he slid to the floorHe whispered in her ear, “This is all your fault.My fighting days have come to a halt.”She touched his lip and kissed his cheekHe tried to speak, but his breath was weak“You died for me, now I'll die for you.”She put the blade to her heart and she ran it throughAll three lovers together in a heapThrown into the grave forever to sleepFuneral torches blazed awayThrough the towns and the villages all night and all dayCopyright  © 2012 ",

    "lyrics": "There’s an iron train a-travelin’ that’s been a-rollin’ through the yearsWith a firebox of hatred and a furnace full of fearsIf you ever heard its sound or seen its blood-red broken frameThen you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my nameDid you ever stop to wonder ’bout the hatred that it holds?Did you ever see its passengers, its crazy mixed-up souls?Did you ever start a-thinkin’ that you gotta stop that train?Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my nameDo you ever get tired of the preachin’ sounds of fearWhen they’re hammered at your head and pounded in your ear?Have you ever asked about it and not been answered plain?Then you heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my nameI’m a-wonderin’ if the leaders of the nations understandThis murder-minded world that they’re leavin’ in my handsHave you ever laid awake at night and wondered ’bout the same?Then you’ve heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my nameHave you ever had it on your lips or said it in your headThat the person standin’ next to you just might be misled?Does the raving of the maniacs make your insides go insane?Then you’ve heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my nameDo the kill-crazy bandits and the haters get you down?Does the preachin’ and the politics spin your head around?Does the burning of the buses give your heart a pain?Then you’ve heard my voice a-singin’ and you know my name 1968 by Warner Bros.

Been so long since I held you tightBeen so long since we said goodnightThe taste of tears is bittersweetWhen you’re near me, my heart forgets to beatYou’re there every night among the good and the true And I’ll be around, waitin’ for youThe king of them all is starting to fallI lost my gal at the boatman’s ballThe night has a thousand hearts and eyesHope may vanish but it never diesI’ll see you tomorrow when freedom ringsI’m gonna stay on top of thingsIt’s the middle of the summer and the moon is blue I’ll be around waitin’ for youAnother deal gone down, another man done gone You put up with it all and you carry onSomething holding you back but you’ll come through I’d bet the world and everything in it on you Happiness is but a state of mindAnytime you want you can cross the state line You don’t need to be rich or well-to-doI’ll be around waitin’ for you 2002 ",

    "lyrics": "There’s a long-distance train rolling through the rainTears on the letter I writeThere’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so muchBut she’s drifting like a satelliteThere’s a neon light ablaze in this green smoky hazeLaughter down on Elizabeth StreetAnd a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stoneWhere she bathed in a stream of pure heatHer father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwiseBut he practiced what he preached from the heartA full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted to meThe time and the place that the trouble would startThere’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rageAnd a longtime golden-haired stripper onstageAnd she winds back the clock and she turns back the pageOf a book that no one can writeOh, where are you tonight?The truth was obscure, too profound and too pureTo live it you have to explodeIn that last hour of need, we entirely agreedSacrifice was the code of the roadI left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. JohnStrong men belittled by doubtI couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts wereBut she had some way of finding them outHe took dead-center aim but he missed just the sameShe was waiting, putting flowers on the shelfShe could feel my despair as I climbed up her hairAnd discovered her invisible selfThere’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escapedThere’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being rapedAs her beauty fades and I watch her undrapeI won’t but then again, maybe I mightOh, if I could just find you tonightI fought with my twin, that enemy within’Til both of us fell by the wayHorseplay and disease is killing me by degreesWhile the law looks the other wayYour partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimesThe guy you were lovin’ couldn’t stay cleanIt felt outa place, my foot in his faceBut he should-a stayed where his money was greenI bit into the root of forbidden fruitWith the juice running down my legThen I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about lossAnd who always was too proud to begThere’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this roomAnd a pathway that leads up to the starsIf you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradiseRemind me to show you the scarsThere’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrivedIf I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survivedI can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m aliveBut without you it just doesn’t seem rightOh, where are you tonight? 1978 ",
