    "lyrics": "I crossed the green mountain, I slept by the stream <br>\nHeaven blazin’ in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream <br>\nSomething came up out of the sea<br>\nSwept through the land of the rich and the free<br>\n<br>\nI look into the eyes of my merciful friend<br>\nAnd then I ask myself, is this the end? <br>\nMemories linger, sad yet sweet<br>\nAnd I think of the souls in heaven who will meet<br>\n<br>\nAltars are burning with flames falling wide<br>\nThe foe has crossed over from the other side<br>\nThey tip their caps from the top of the hill<br>\nYou can feel them come, more brave blood to spill<br>\n<br>\nAlong the dim Atlantic line<br>\nThe ravaged land lies for miles behind<br>\nThe light’s comin’ forward and the streets are broad <br>\nAll must yield to the avenging God<br>\n<br>\nThe world is old, the world is gray<br>\nLessons of life can’t be learned in a day<br>\nI watch and I wait and I listen while I stand<br>\nTo the music that comes from a far better land<br>\n<br>\nClose the eyes of our Captain, peace may he know <br>\nHis long night is done, the great leader is laid low <br>\nHe was ready to fall, he was quick to defend<br>\nKilled outright he was by his own men<br>\n<br>\nIt’s the last day’s last hour of the last happy year <br>\nI feel that the unknown world is so near<br>\nPride will vanish and glory will rot<br>\nBut virtue lives and cannot be forgot<br>\n<br>\nThe bells of evening have rung<br>\nThere’s blasphemy on every tongue<br>\nLet them say that I walked in fair nature’s light <br>\nAnd that I was loyal to truth and to right<br>\n<br>\nServe God and be cheerful, look upward beyond<br>\nBeyond the darkness that masks the surprises of dawn<br>\nIn the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood<br>\nThey never dreamed of surrendering. They fell where they stood<br>\n<br>\nStars fell over Alabama, I saw each star<br>\nYou’re walkin’ in dreams whoever you are <br>\nChilled are the skies, keen is the frost<br>\nThe ground’s froze hard and the morning is lost<br>\n<br>\nA letter to mother came today<br>\nGunshot wound to the breast is what it did say <br>\nBut he’ll be better soon he’s in a hospital bed <br>\nBut he’ll never be better, he’s already dead<br>\n<br>\nI’m ten miles outside the city and I’m lifted away<br>\nIn an ancient light that is not of day<br>\nThey were calm, they were blunt, we knew ’em all too well <br>\nWe loved each other more than we ever dared to tell\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 2002 by Special Rider Music</p>",

    "song": "‘Til I Fell in Love with You",
    "lyrics": "Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense<br>\nI feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence<br>\nI’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much<br>\nNothing can heal me now, but your touch<br>\nI don’t know what I’m gonna do<br>\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you<br>\n<br>\nWell, my house is on fire, burning to the sky<br>\nI thought it would rain but the clouds passed by<br>\nNow I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way<br>\nBut I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray<br>\nStill I don’t know what I’m gonna do<br>\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you<br>\n<br>\nBoys in the street beginning to play<br>\nGirls like birds flying away<br>\nWhen I’m gone you will remember my name<br>\nI’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame<br>\nI don’t know what I’m gonna do<br>\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you<br>\n<br>\nJunk is piling up, taking up space<br>\nMy eyes feel like they’re falling off my face<br>\nSweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor<br>\nI’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more<br>\nI don’t know what I’m gonna do<br>\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you<br>\n<br>\nWell, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain<br>\nMy attempts to please you were all in vain<br>\nTomorrow night before the sun goes down<br>\nIf I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound<br>\nI just don’t know what I’m gonna do<br>\nI was all right ’til I fell in love with you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1997 by Special Rider Music</p>",
