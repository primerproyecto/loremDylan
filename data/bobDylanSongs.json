They fell where they stood<br>\n<br>\nStars fell over Alabama, I saw each star<br>\nYou’re walkin’ in dreams whoever you are <br>\nChilled are the skies, keen is the frost<br>\nThe ground’s froze hard and the morning is lost<br>\n<br>\nA letter to mother came today<br>\nGunshot wound to the breast is what it did say <br>\nBut he’ll be better soon he’s in a hospital bed <br>\nBut he’ll never be better, he’s already dead<br>\n<br>\nI’m ten miles outside the city and I’m lifted away<br>\nIn an ancient light that is not of day<br>\nThey were calm, they were blunt, we knew ’em all too well <br>\nWe loved each other more than we ever dared to tell\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 2002 by Special Rider Music</p>",

    "lyrics": "I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze<br>\nWith the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn<br>\nI courted her proudly but now she is gone<br>\nGone as the season she’s taken<br>\n<br>\nThrough young summer’s breeze, I stole her away<br>\nFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stay<br>\nEach one of them suffering from the failures of their day<br>\nWith strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us<br>\n<br>\nOf the two sisters, I loved the young<br>\nWith sensitive instincts, she was the creative one<br>\nThe constant scapegoat, she was easily undone<br>\nBy the jealousy of others around her<br>\n<br>\nFor her parasite sister, I had no respect<br>\nBound by her boredom, her pride to protect<br>\nCountless visions of the other she’d reflect<br>\nAs a crutch for her scenes and her society<br>\n<br>\nMyself, for what I did, I cannot be excused<br>\nThe changes I was going through can’t even be used<br>\nFor the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose<br>\nThe could-be dream-lover of my lifetime<br>\n<br>\nWith unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip<br>\nA magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped<br>\nNoticing not that I’d already slipped<br>\nTo a sin of love’s false security<br>\n<br>\nFrom silhouetted anger to manufactured peace<br>\nAnswers of emptiness, voice vacancies<br>\nTill the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, “Please<br>\nWhat’s wrong and what’s exactly the matter?”<br>\n<br>\nAnd so it did happen like it could have been foreseen<br>\nThe timeless explosion of fantasy’s dream<br>\nAt the peak of the night, the king and the queen<br>\nTumbled all down into pieces<br>\n<br>\n“The tragic figure!” her sister did shout<br>\n“Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!”<br>\nAnd I in my armor, turning about<br>\nAnd nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness<br>\n<br>\nBeneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound<br>\nHer sister and I in a screaming battleground<br>\nAnd she in between, the victim of sound<br>\nSoon shattered as a child ’neath her shadows<br>\n<br>\nAll is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight<br>\nI gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight<br>\nMy mind it was mangled, I ran into the night<br>\nLeaving all of love’s ashes behind me<br>\n<br>\nThe wind knocks my window, the room it is wet<br>\nThe words to say I’m sorry, I haven’t found yet<br>\nI think of her often and hope whoever she’s met<br>\nWill be fully aware of how precious she is<br>\n<br>\nAh, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me<br>\n“How good, how good does it feel to be free?”<br>\nAnd I answer them most mysteriously<br>\n“Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?”\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1964 by Warner Bros.

    "song": "Brownsville Girl",
    "lyrics": "Well, there was this movie I seen one time<br>\nAbout a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck<br>\nHe was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself<br>\nThe townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck<br>\n<br>\nWell, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp<br>\nAs the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath<br>\n“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square<br>\nI want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”<br>\n<br>\nWell, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in<br>\nAnd you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain<br>\nYou know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart<br>\nThe memory of you keeps callin’ after me like a rollin’ train<br>\n<br>\nI can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert<br>\nIn your busted down Ford and your platform heels<br>\nI could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet<br>\nAh, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel<br>\n<br>\nWell, we drove that car all night into San Anton’<br>\nAnd we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft<br>\nWay down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back<br>\nI would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off<br>\n<br>\nWell, we’re drivin’ this car and the sun is comin’ up over the Rockies<br>\nNow I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul<br>\nBut I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I was your only man<br>\nAnd she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control<br>\n<br>\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br>\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world<br>\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love<br>\n<br>\nWell, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo<br>\nWe pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a wreckin’ lot <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside of town about a mile<br>\nRuby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust<br>\nShe said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”<br>\n<br>\nThen she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin’ of<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bummin’ a ride back to from where she started<br>\nBut ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up<br>\nShe said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could tell she was so broken hearted<br>\nShe said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”<br>\n<br>\n“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh<br>\n“We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn<br>\n’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”<br>\nRuby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”<br>\n<br>\nSomething about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head<br>\nBut I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play<br>\nAll I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved<br>\nAnd a lot of them seemed to be lookin’ my way<br>\n<br>\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,<br>\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world<br>\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love<br>\n<br>\nWell, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour<br>\nI was crossin’ the street when shots rang out<br>\nI didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran<br>\n“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout<br>\n<br>\nWell, you saw my picture in the <i>Corpus Christi Tribune</i>. Underneath it,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it said, “A man with no alibi”<br>\nYou went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you<br>\nThen when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears<br>\nIt was the best acting I saw anybody do<br>\n<br>\nNow I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but sometimes you just find yourself over the line<br>\nOh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now<br>\nYou know, I feel pretty good, but that ain’t sayin’ much. <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could feel a whole lot better<br>\nIf you were just here by my side to show me how<br>\n<br>\nWell, I’m standin’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck<br>\nYeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind<br>\nHe’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about<br>\nBut I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line<br>\n<br>\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br>\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world<br>\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love<br>\n<br>\nYou know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned<br>\nThe only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter<br>\nAnd you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was always too good for this world<br>\nJust like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I left behind in the French Quarter<br>\n<br>\nStrange how people who suffer together have stronger connections <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than people who are most content<br>\nI don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone<br>\nYou always said people don’t do what they believe in, <br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent<br>\nAnd I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”<br>\n<br>\nThere was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice<br>\nI don’t remember who I was or where I was bound<br>\nAll I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he was shot in the back<br>\nSeems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down<br>\n<br>\nBrownsville girl with your Brownsville curls<br>\nTeeth like pearls shining like the moon above<br>\nBrownsville girl, show me all around the world<br>\nBrownsville girl, you’re my honey love\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1986 by Special Rider Music</p>",

Highland<br>\nI’m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go<br>\n<br>\nWindows were shakin’ all night in my dreams<br>\nEverything was exactly the way that it seems<br>\nWoke up this morning and I looked at the same old page<br>\nSame ol’ rat race<br>\nLife in the same ol’ cage<br>\n<br>\nI don’t want nothing from anyone, ain’t that much to take<br>\nWouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake<br>\nFeel like a prisoner in a world of mystery<br>\nI wish someone would come<br>\nAnd push back the clock for me<br>\n<br>\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam<br>\nThat’s where I’ll be when I get called home<br>\nThe wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme<br>\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands<br>\nI can only get there one step at a time<br>\n<br>\nI’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound<br>\nSomeone’s always yelling turn it down<br>\nFeel like I’m drifting<br>\nDrifting from scene to scene<br>\nI’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?<br>\n<br>\nInsanity is smashing up against my soul<br>\nYou can say I was on anything but a roll<br>\nIf I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top<br>\nWhat would I do with it anyway<br>\nMaybe take it to the pawn shop<br>\n<br>\nMy heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn<br>\nBy the beautiful lake of the Black Swan<br>\nBig white clouds like chariots that swing down low<br>\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands<br>\nOnly place left to go<br>\n<br>\nI’m in Boston town, in some restaurant<br>\nI got no idea what I want<br>\nWell, maybe I do but I’m just really not sure<br>\nWaitress comes over<br>\nNobody in the place but me and her<br>\n<br>\nIt must be a holiday, there’s nobody around<br>\nShe studies me closely as I sit down<br>\nShe got a pretty face and long white shiny legs<br>\nShe says, “What’ll it be?”<br>\nI say, “I don’t know, you got any soft boiled eggs?”<br>\n<br>\nShe looks at me, says, “I’d bring you some<br>\nBut we’re out of ’m, you picked the wrong time to come”<br>\nThen she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me!”<br>\nI say, “I would if I could, but<br>\nI don’t do sketches from memory”<br>\n<br>\n“Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”<br>\nI say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book!”<br>\nShe gives me a napkin, she says, “You can do it on that”<br>\nI say, “Yes I could, but<br>\nI don’t know where my pencil is at!”<br>\n<br>\nShe pulls one out from behind her ear<br>\nShe says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”<br>\nI make a few lines and I show it for her to see<br>\nWell she takes the napkin and throws it back<br>\nAnd says, “That don’t look a thing like me!”<br>\n<br>\nI said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”<br>\nShe says, “You must be jokin’.” I say, “I wish I was!”<br>\nThen she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”<br>\nLeast that’s what I think I hear her say<br>\n“Well,” I say, “how would you know and what would it matter anyway?”<br>\n<br>\n“Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do!”<br>\nI said, “You’re way wrong”<br>\nShe says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”<br>\nShe goes away for a minute<br>\nAnd I slide up out of my chair<br>\nI step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere<br>\n<br>\nWell my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds<br>\nWay up in the border country, far from the towns<br>\nWith the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow<br>\nMy heart’s in the Highlands<br>\nCan’t see any other way to go<br>\n<br>\nEvery day is the same thing out the door<br>\nFeel further away then ever before<br>\nSome things in life, it gets too late to learn<br>\nWell, I’m lost somewhere<br>\nI must have made a few bad turns<br>\n<br>\nI see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes<br>\nThey’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes<br>\nAll the young men with their young women looking so good<br>\nWell, I’d trade places with any of them<br>\nIn a minute, if I could<br>\n<br>\nI’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog<br>\nTalking to myself in a monologue<br>\nI think what I need might be a full-length leather coat<br>\nSomebody just asked me<br>\nIf I registered to vote<br>\n<br>\nThe sun is beginning to shine on me<br>\nBut it’s not like the sun that used to be<br>\nThe party’s over and there’s less and less to say<br>\nI got new eyes<br>\nEverything looks far away<br>\n<br>\nWell, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day<br>\nOver the hills and far away<br>\nThere’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow<br>\nBut I’m already there in my mind<br>\nAnd that’s good enough for now\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1997 by Special Rider Music</p>",

slow-motion crawl of life's busy race<br>\nNo matter what yer doing if you start givin' up<br>\nIf the wine don't come to the top of yer cup<br>\nIf the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on<br>\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone<br>\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it<br>\nAnd the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it<br>\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long<br>\nAnd you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong<br>\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day<br>\nAnd tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away<br>\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'<br>\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'<br>\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys<br>\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys<br>\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'<br>\nAnd the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'<br>\nAnd the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'<br>\nAnd yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'<br>\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm<br>\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say<br>\n\"I never knew it was gonna be this way<br>\nWhy didn't they tell me the day I was born\"<br>\nAnd you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat<br>\nAnd you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet<br>\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air<br>\nAnd the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare<br>\nAnd yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying<br>\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'<br>\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet<br>\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on the street<br>\nAnd yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat<br>\nAnd you think yer ears might a been hurt<br>\nOr yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt<br>\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rush<br>\nWhen you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush<br>\nAnd all the time you were holdin' three queens<br>\nAnd it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean<br>\nLike in the middle of Life magazine<br>\nBouncin' around a pinball machine<br>\nAnd there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying<br>\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin'<br>\nBut it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head<br>\nAnd it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed<br>\nAnd no matter how you try you just can't say it<br>\nAnd yer scared to yer soul  you just might forget it<br>\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head<br>\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead<br>\nAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth<br>\nAnd his jaws start closin with you underneath<br>\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind<br>\nAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign<br>\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin'<br>\nOn this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'<br>\nOn this curve I'm hanging<br>\nOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking<br>\nIn this air I'm inhaling<br>\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard<br>\nWhy am I walking, where am I running<br>\nWhat am  I saying, what am I knowing<br>\nOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'<br>\nOn this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'<br>\nIn the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'<br>\nIn the words that I'm thinkin'<br>\nIn this ocean of hours I'm  all the time drinkin'<br>\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking<br>\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking<br>\nBut you try with your whole soul best<br>\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let<br>\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground<br>\nOr make yer heart pound<br>\nBut then again you know why they're around<br>\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down<br>\n\"Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping<br>\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping<br>\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'<br>\nAnd you can't remember for the best of yer thinking<br>\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming<br>\nAnd you know that it's something special you're needin'<br>\nAnd you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'<br>\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding<br>\nAnd you need something special<br>\nYeah, you need something special all right<br>\nYou need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track<br>\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back<br>\nYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler<br>\nThat's been banging and booming and blowing forever<br>\nThat knows yer troubles a hundred times over<br>\nYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race<br>\nThat won't laugh at yer looks<br>\nYour voice or your face<br>\nAnd by any number of bets in the book<br>\nWill be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze<br>\nYou need something to open up a new door<br>\nTo show you something you seen before<br>\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more<br>\nYou need something to open your eyes<br>\nYou need something to make it known<br>\nThat it's you and no one else that owns<br>\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting<br>\nThat the world ain't got you beat<br>\nThat it ain't got you licked<br>\nIt can't get you crazy no matter how many<br>\nTimes you might get kicked<br>\nYou need something special all right<br>\nYou need something special to give you hope<br>\nBut hope's just a word<br>\nThat maybe you said or maybe you heard<br>\nOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve<br>\n<br>\nBut that's what you need man, and you need it bad<br>\nAnd yer trouble is you know it too good<br>\n\"Cause you look an' you start getting the chills<br>\n<br>\n\"Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill<br>\nAnd it ain't on Macy's window sill<br>\nAnd it ain't on no rich kid's road

raving and taking yer money<br>\nAnd you thinks it's funny<br>\nNo you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club<br>\nAnd it ain't in the seats of a supper club<br>\nAnd sure as hell you're

Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”<br>\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim<br>\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him<br>\nStarin’ at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child<br>\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she    smiled<br>\nShe’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs<br>\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere<br>\nBut she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nThe hangin’ judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined<br>\nThe drillin’ in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind<br>\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring<br>\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king<br>\nNo, nothin’ ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nRosemary started drinkin’ hard and seein’ her reflection in the knife<br>\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playin’ the role of Big Jim’s wife<br>\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide<br>\nWas lookin’ to do just one good deed before she died<br>\nShe was gazin’ to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nLily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away<br>\n“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have known it would someday<br>\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint<br>\nI’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re lookin’ like a saint”<br>\nDown the hallway footsteps were comin’ for the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair<br>\n“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”<br>\nHe went to get the hangin’ judge, but the hangin’ judge was drunk<br>\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk<br>\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nLily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch<br>\nShe forgot all about the man she couldn’t stand who hounded her so much<br>\n“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere<br>\nBut just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear<br>\nJust another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick<br>\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked<br>\nAnd Big Jim was standin’ there, ya couldn’t say surprised<br>\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes<br>\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leanin’ to the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall<br>\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul<br>\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground<br>\nFor one more member who had business back in town<br>\nBut they couldn’t go no further without the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nThe next day was hangin’ day, the sky was overcast and black<br>\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back<br>\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn’t even blink<br>\nThe hangin’ judge was sober, he hadn’t had a drink<br>\nThe only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts<br>\n<br>\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”<br>\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair<br>\nShe was thinkin’ ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw<br>\nThinkin’ ’bout Rosemary and thinkin’ about the law<br>\nBut most of all she was thinkin’ ’bout the Jack of Hearts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1974 by Ram's

No!<br>\nI’m a doctor and it’s true<br>\nI’m a clean-cut kid<br>\nAnd I been to college, too”<br>\n<br>\nThen in comes his daughter<br>\nWhose name was Rita<br>\nShe looked like she stepped out of<br>\n<i>La Dolce Vita</i><br>\nI immediately tried to cool it<br>\nWith her dad<br>\nAnd told him what a<br>\nNice, pretty farm he had<br>\nHe said, “What do doctors<br>\nKnow about farms, pray tell?”<br>\nI said, “I was born<br>\nAt the bottom of a wishing well”<br>\n<br>\nWell, by the dirt ’neath my nails<br>\nI guess he knew I wouldn’t lie<br>\n“I guess you’re tired”<br>\nHe said, kinda sly<br>\nI said, “Yes, ten thousand miles<br>\nToday I drove”<br>\nHe said, “I got a bed for you<br>\nUnderneath the stove<br>\nJust one condition<br>\nAnd you go to sleep right now<br>\nThat you don’t touch my daughter<br>\nAnd in the morning, milk the cow”<br>\n<br>\nI was sleepin’ like a rat<br>\nWhen I heard something jerkin’<br>\nThere stood Rita<br>\nLookin’ just like Tony Perkins<br>\nShe said, “Would you like to take a shower?<br>\nI’ll show you up to the door”<br>\nI said, “Oh, no! no!<br>\nI’ve been through this before”<br>\nI knew I had to split<br>\nBut I didn’t know how<br>\nWhen she said<br>\n“Would you like to take that shower, now?”<br>\n<br>\nWell, I couldn’t leave<br>\nUnless the old man chased me out<br>\n’Cause I’d already promised<br>\nThat I’d milk his cows<br>\nI had to say something<br>\nTo strike him very weird<br>\nSo I yelled out<br>\n“I like Fidel Castro and his beard”<br>\nRita looked offended<br>\nBut she got out of the way<br>\nAs he came charging down the stairs<br>\nSayin’, “What’s that I heard you say?”<br>\n<br>\nI said, “I like Fidel Castro<br>\nI think you heard me right”<br>\nAnd ducked as he swung<br>\nAt me with all his might<br>\nRita mumbled something<br>\n’Bout her mother on the hill<br>\nAs his fist hit the icebox<br>\nHe said he’s going to kill me<br>\nIf I don’t get out the door<br>\nIn two seconds flat<br>\n“You unpatriotic<br>\nRotten doctor Commie rat”<br>\n<br>\nWell, he threw a <i>Reader’s Digest</i><br>\nAt my head and I did run<br>\nI did a somersault<br>\nAs I seen him get his gun<br>\nAnd crashed through the window<br>\nAt a hundred miles an hour<br>\nAnd landed fully blast<br>\nIn his garden flowers<br>\nRita said, “Come back!”<br>\nAs he started to load<br>\nThe sun was comin’ up<br>\nAnd I was runnin’ down the road<br>\n<br>\nWell, I don’t figure I’ll be back<br>\nThere for a spell<br>\nEven though Rita moved away<br>\nAnd got a job in a motel<br>\nHe still waits for me<br>\nConstant, on the sly<br>\nHe wants to turn me in<br>\nTo the F.B.I.<br>\nMe, I romp and stomp<br>\nThankful as I romp<br>\nWithout freedom of speech<br>\nI might be in the swamp\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1964 by Warner Bros.

    "lyrics": "The pale moon rose in its glory<br>\nOut on the western town<br>\nShe told a sad, sad story<br>\nOf the great ship that went down<br>\n<br>\n‘Twas the fourteen day of April<br>\nOver the waves she rode<br>\nSailing into tomorrow<br>\nTo a golden age foretold<br>\n<br>\nThe night was bright with starlight<br>\nThe seas were sharp and clear<br>\nMoving through the shadows<br>\nThe promised hour was near<br>\n<br>\nLights were holding steady<br>\nGliding over the foam<br>\nAll the lords and ladies<br>\nHeading for their eternal home<br>\n<br>\nThe chandeliers were swaying<br>\nFrom the balustrades above<br>\nThe orchestra was playing<br>\nSongs of faded love<br>\n<br>\nThe watchman he lay dreaming<br>\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled<br>\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br>\nInto the underworld<br>\n   <br>\nLeo took his sketchbook<br>\nHe was often so inclined<br>\nHe closed his eyes and painted<br>\nThe scenery in his mind<br>\n<br>\nCupid struck his bosom<br>\nAnd broke it with a snap<br>\nThe closest woman to him<br>\nHe fell into her lap<br>\n<br>\nHe heard a loud commotion<br>\nSomething sounded wrong<br>\nHis inner spirit was saying<br>\nThat he couldn’t stand here long<br>\n<br>\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck<br>\nNo time now to sleep <br>\nWater on the quarterdeck<br>\nAlready three foot deep<br>\n<br>\nSmokestack leaning sideways<br>\nHeavy feet began to pound<br>\nHe walked into the whirlwind<br>\nSky spinning all around<br>\n<br>\nThe ship was going under<br>\nThe universe opened wide<br>\nThe roll was called up yonder<br>\nThe angels turned aside<br>\n<br>\nLights down in the hallway<br>\nFlickering dim and dull<br>\nDead bodies already floating<br>\nIn the double bottomed hull<br>\n<br>\nThe engines then exploded<br>\nPropellers they failed to start<br>\nThe boilers overloaded<br>\nThe ship's bow split apart<br>\n<br>\nPassengers were flying<br>\nBackward, forward, far and fast<br>\nThey mumbled, fumbled, tumbled<br>\nEach one more weary than the last<br>\n<br>\nThe veil was torn asunder<br>\n‘Tween the hours of twelve and one<br>\nNo change, no sudden wonder<br>\nCould undo what had been done<br>\n<br>\nThe watchman lay there dreaming<br>\nAt fourty-five degrees<br>\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br>\nDropping to her knees<br>\n<br>\nWellington, he was sleeping<br>\nHis bed began to slide<br>\nHis valiant heart was beating<br>\nHe pushed the tables aside<br>\n<br>\nGlass of shattered crystal<br>\nLay scattered ‘round about<br>\nHe strapped on both his pistols  <br>\nHow long could he hold out?<br>\n<br>\nHis men and his companions<br>\nWere nowhere to be seen<br>\nIn silence there he waited for<br>\nTime and space to intervene<br>\n<br>\nThe passageway was narrow<br>\nThere was blackness in the air<br>\nHe saw every kind of sorrow<br>\nHeard voices everywhere<br>\n<br>\nAlarm bells were ringing<br>\nTo hold back the swelling tide<br>\nFriends and lovers clinging<br>\nTo each other side by side<br>\n<br>\nMothers and their daughters<br>\nDescending down the stairs<br>\nJumped into the icy waters<br>\nLove and pity sent their prayers<br>\n<br>\nThe rich man, Mr. Astor<br>\nKissed his darling wife<br>\nHe had no way of knowing<br>\nBe the last trip of his life<br>\n<br>\nCalvin, Blake and Wilson <br>\nGambled in the dark<br>\nNot one of them would ever live to<br>\nTell the tale of disembark<br>\n<br>\nBrother rose up against brother<br>\nIn every circumstance<br>\nThey fought and slaughtered each other<br>\nIn a deadly dance<br>\n<br>\nThey lowered down the lifeboats<br>\nFrom the sinking wreck<br>\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats<br>\nBroken backs and broken necks<br>\n<br>\nThe bishop left his cabin<br>\nTo help all those in need<br>\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens<br>\nSaid, “The poor are yours to feed.”<br>\n<br>\nDavey the brothel keeper<br>\nCame out, dismissed his girls<br>\nSaw the water getting deeper<br>\nSaw the changing of his world<br>\n<br>\nJim Dandy smiled<br>\nHe'd never learned to swim<br>\nSaw the little crippled child<br>\nAnd he gave his seat to him<br>\n<br>\nHe saw the starlight shining<br>\nStreaming from the East<br>\nDeath was on the rampage<br>\nBut his heart was now at peace<br>\n<br>\nThey battened down the hatches<br>\nBut the hatches wouldn’t hold<br>\nThey drowned upon the staircase<br>\nOf brass and polished gold<br>\n<br>\nLeo said to Cleo<br>\n“I think I’m going mad.”<br>\nBut he'd lost his mind already<br>\nWhatever mind he had<br>\n<br>\nHe tried to block the doorway<br>\nTo save all those from harm<br>\nBlood from an open wound<br>\nPouring down his arm<br>\n<br>\nPetals fell from flowers<br>\n‘Til all of them were gone<br>\nIn the long and dreadful hours<br>\nThe wizard’s curse played on<br>\n<br>\nThe host was pouring brandy<br>\nHe was going down slow<br>\nHe stayed right ‘til the end<br>\nHe was the last to go<br>\n<br>\nThere were many, many others<br>\nNameless here forevermore<br>\nThey'd never sailed the ocean<br>\nOr left their homes before<br>\n<br>\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming<br>\nThe damage had been done<br>\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking<br>\nAnd he tried to tell someone<br>\n<br>\nThe captain, barely breathing<br>\nKneeling at the wheel<br>\nAbove him and beneath him<br>\nFifty thousand tons of steel<br>\n<br>\nHe looked over at his compass<br>\nAnd he gazed into its face<br>\nNeedle pointing downward<br>\nHe knew he lost the race<br>\n<br>\nIn the dark illumination<br>\nHe remembered bygone years<br>\nHe read the Book of Revelation<br>\nAnd he filled his cup with tears<br>\n<br>\nWhen the Reaper’s task had ended<br>\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest<br>\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor<br>\nThe loveliest and the best<br>\n<br>\nThey waited at the landing<br>\nAnd they tried to understand<br>\nBut there is no understanding<br>\nOn the judgment of God’s hand<br>\n<br>\nNews came over the wires<br>\nAnd struck with deadly force<br>\nLove had lost its fires<br>\nAll things had run their course<br>\n<br>\nThe watchman he lay dreaming<br>\nOf all things

    "lyrics": "’Twas down in Mississippi not so long ago<br>\nWhen a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door<br>\nThis boy’s dreadful tragedy I can still remember well<br>\nThe color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till<br>\n<br>\nSome men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up<br>\nThey said they had a reason, but I can’t remember what<br>\nThey tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat<br>\nThere were screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out on the street<br>\n<br>\nThen they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain<br>\nAnd they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain<br>\nThe reason that they killed him there, and I’m sure it ain’t no lie<br>\nWas just for the fun of killin’ him and to watch him slowly die<br>\n<br>\nAnd then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial<br>\nTwo brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till<br>\nBut on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awful crime<br>\nAnd so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind<br>\n<br>\nI saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see<br>\nThe smiling brothers walkin’ down the courthouse stairs<br>\nFor the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free<br>\nWhile Emmett’s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea<br>\n<br>\nIf you can’t speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that’s so unjust<br>\nYour eyes are filled with dead men’s dirt, your mind is filled with dust<br>\nYour arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must refuse to flow<br>\nFor you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!<br>\n<br>\nThis song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man<br>\nThat this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan<br>\nBut if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give<br>\nWe could make this great land of ours a greater place to live\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1963, 1968 by Warner Bros.

    "lyrics": "It was late last night when the boss came home<br>\nTo a deserted mansion and a desolate throne<br>\nServant said, “Boss, the lady’s gone<br>\nShe left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”<br>\n<br>\n“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man. <br>\nCome to the point as straight as you can.”<br>\n“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan, <br>\nCame riding through the woods and took her by the hand.” <br>\n<br>\nThe boss he laid back flat on his bed<br>\nHe cursed the heat and he clutched his head<br>\nHe pondered the future of his fate <br>\nTo wait another day would be far too late<br>\n<br>\n\"Go fetch me my coat and my tie<br>\nAnd the cheapest labor that money can buy<br>\nSaddle me up my buckskin mare<br>\nIf you see me go by, put up a prayer.\"<br>\n<br>\nWell, they rode all night and they rode all day<br>\nEastward long on the broad highway <br>\nHis spirit was tired and his vision was bent<br>\nHis men deserted him and onward he went<br>\n<br>\nHe came to a place where the light was dull<br>\nHis forehead pounding in his skull<br>\nHeavy heart was wracked with pain<br>\nInsomnia raging in his brain<br>\n<br>\nWell he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword<br>\nHe renounced his faith, he denied his Lord<br>\nCrawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall<br>\nOne way or another he'd put an end to it all<br>\n<br>\nHe leaned down, cut the electric wire <br>\nStared into the flames and he snorted the fire<br>\nPeered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two<br>\nIt was hard to tell for certain who was who<br>\n<br>\nHe lowered himself down on a golden chain<br>\nHis nerves were quaking in every vein<br>\nHis knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air<br>\nHe ran his fingers through his greasy hair<br>\n<br>\nThey looked at each other and their glasses clinked<br>\nOne single unit inseparably linked <br>\n“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by.”<br>\n“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly.”<br>\n<br>\nFrom behind the curtain the boss crossed the floor<br>\nHe moved his feet and he bolted the door<br>\nShadows hiding the lines in his face<br>\nWith all the nobility of an ancient race<br>\n<br>\nShe turned, she was startled with a look of surprise<br>\nWith a hatred that could hit the skies<br>\n“You’re a reckless fool, I can see it in your eyes.<br>\nTo come this way was by no means wise.”<br>\n<br>\n“Get up, stand up, you greedy lipped wench<br>\nAnd cover your face or suffer the consequence.<br>\nYou are making my heart full sick.<br>\nPut your clothes back on double quick.”<br>\n<br>\n“Silly boy, you think me a saint.<br>\nI’ll listen no more to your words of complaint.<br>\nYou’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies.<br>\nNow hold your tongue and feed your eyes.”<br>\n<br>\n“I’d have given you the stars and the planets too<br>\nBut what good would these things do you?<br>\nBow the heart, if not the knee<br>\nOr never again this world you’ll see.”<br>\n<br>\n “Oh, please let not your heart be cold.<br>\nThis man is dearer to me than gold.”<br>\n“Oh my dear, you must be blind.<br>\nHe’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind.”<br>\n<br>\n“You had your way too long with me.<br>\nNow it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be.<br>\nTry to escape,” he cussed and cursed<br>\n“You’ll have to try to get past me first.”<br>\n<br>\n“I dare not let your passion rule.<br>\nYou think my heart, the heart of a fool.<br>\nAnd you sir, you cannot deny <br>\nYou made a monkey of me, what and for why?”<br>\n<br>\n“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat.<br>\nThe devil can have you, I’ll see to that.<br>\nLook sharp or step aside,<br>\nOr in the cradle you’ll wish you died.”<br>\n<br>\nThe gun went boom and the shot rang clear<br>\nFirst bullet grazed his ear<br>\nSecond ball went right straight in<br>\nAnd he bent in the middle like a twisted pin<br>\n<br>\nHe crawled to the corner and he lowered his head<br>\nHe gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed<br>\nIt would take more than needle and thread<br>\nBleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead<br>\n<br>\n“You shot my husband down, you fiend.”<br>\n“Husband, what husband, what the hell do you mean?<br>\nHe was a man of strife, a man of sin.<br>\nI cut him down and I’ll throw him to the wind.”<br>\n<br>\n“Hear this,” she said, with angry breath<br>\n“You too shall meet the lord of death.<br>\nIt was I who brought your soul to life.”<br>\nAnd she raised her robe and she drew out a knife<br>\n<br>\nHis face was hard and caked with sweat<br>\nHis arms ached and his hands were wet<br>\n“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife.<br>\nIf you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife.”<br>\n<br>\n“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot.<br>\nBut we’re no way similar in body and thought.<br>\nAll husbands are good men, as all wives know.”<br>\nThen she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow<br>\n<br>\nHis knees went limp and he reached for the door<br>\nHis doom was sealed, he slid to the floor<br>\nHe whispered in her ear, “This is all your fault.<br>\nMy fighting days have come to a halt.”<br>\n<br>\nShe touched his lip and kissed his cheek<br>\nHe tried to speak, but his breath was weak<br>\n“You died for me, now I'll die for you.”<br>\nShe put the blade to her heart and she ran it through<br>\n<br>\nAll three lovers together in a heap<br>\nThrown into the grave forever to sleep<br>\nFuneral torches blazed away<br>\nThrough the towns and the villages all night and all day<br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright  © 2012 by Special

    "lyrics": "I was listening to the voices of death on parade<br>\nSinging about conspiracy, wanted me to be afraid<br>\nWorking for a system I couldn't understand or trust<br>\nSuffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust<br>\n<br>\nBut you changed my life<br>\nCame along in a time of strife<br>\nIn hunger and need, you made my heart bleed<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\n<br>\nTalk about salvation, people suddenly get tired<br>\nThey got a million things to do, they're all so inspired<br>\nYou do the work of the devil, you got a million friends<br>\nThey'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end<br>\n<br>\nBut you changed my life<br>\nCame along in a time of strife<br>\nI was under the gun, clouds blocking the sun<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\n<br>\nWell, the nature of man is to beg and to steal<br>\nI do it myself, it's not so unreal<br>\nThe call of the wild is forever at my door<br>\nWants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor<br>\n<br>\nBut you changed my life<br>\nCame along in a time of strife<br>\nFrom silver and gold to what man cannot hold<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\n<br>\nI was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray<br>\nI was told I was looking good and to have a nice day<br>\nIt all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite<br>\nEating that absolute garbage while being so discreet<br>\n<br>\nBut you changed my life<br>\nCame along in a time of strife<br>\nFrom silver and gold to what man cannot hold<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\n<br>\nYou were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm<br>\nWhile orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm<br>\nYour eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass<br>\nIn the world you had made they made you an outcast<br>\n<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\nCame along in a time of strife<br>\nFrom silver and gold to what man cannot hold<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\n<br>\nThere was someone in my body that I could hardly see<br>\nInvading my privacy making my decisions for me<br>\nHolding me back, not letting me stand<br>\nMaking me feel like a stranger in a strange land<br>\n<br>\nBut you changed my life<br>\nCame along in a time of strife<br>\nYou come down the line, give me a new mind<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\n<br>\nMy Lord and my Savior, my companion, my friend<br>\nHeart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end<br>\nMy creator, my comforter, my cause for joy<br>\nWhat the world is set against but will never destroy<br>\n<br>\nYou changed my life<br>\nCame along in a time of strife<br>\nYou came in like the wind, like Errol Flynn<br>\nYou changed my life\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"copytext\">Copyright © 1982 by Special Rider Music</p>",
